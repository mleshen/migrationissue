Papa pointed to a bench in front of a liquor store and Marco gratefully dropped onto it.

He looked up and down the street in downtown Tijuana as it swarmed with American tourists. The neighborhood looked grimy and was flagged with graffiti. There was an undeniable sense of mystery and danger here, as if something illegal was about to happen. Marco already felt guilty, even though he hadn't done anything wrong, yet.

Shop owners stood in front of their stalls calling out, “I make you good deal! Come in! I make you good price!” Children ran up to shoppers, determined to sell gum. “Come on lady, you like gum? *Chiclets*? Everybody like gum.” Vendors carried giant bouquets of paper flowers and hurried toward cars on the street, trying to make sales through open windows. It seemed that no one accepted no for an answer. The Mexicans simply begged until the tourists pulled out their wallets.

Marco added up the hours he had been on a bus from his home in *Jocotepec, Jalisco*, in order to reach *Tijuana *. Eighteen hours? Twenty-three hours? It was all a blur of sleeping and sitting in stations and huddling as close to his father as possible so he would not have to smell the sweat of strangers. Now, they were finally in the border town, but their journey still was not over.

"Papa, I'm scared," he whispered.

“*No te preocupes*. Do not worry,” said Papa, reaching into a brown bag of peanuts. He calmly cracked one, peeled it, and let the shells drop on the sidewalk.

Marco looked at him. Papa had the profile of an eagle: a brown bald head with a bird of prey profile. Once, when he was a little boy, Marco had seen a majestic carved wooden Indian in front of a cigar store in Guadalajara and had said, “Papa, that is you!” Papa had laughed but had to agree that the statue looked familiar. Marco looked just like Papa but with a mop of straight black hair. They had the same walnut colored skin and hooked noses but Papa's body was muscular and firm. Marco was skinny and angular, all knees and elbows.

"How do we find *el coyote*?" asked Marco.

"Do not worry," said Papa.  "El coyote will find us, like a real animal stalking its next meal, *el coyote* will sniff us out."

Marco took off his baseball cap, ran his fingers through his thick hair. He repositioned the hat and took a deep breath. “Papa, what happens if we get caught?”

“We have been over this,” said Papa, still cracking peanuts. “We will have to spend a few hours at the Border Office. We stand in line. They ask us questions. We give them the names we discussed. They take our fingerprints. Then we make our way back here to Tijuana. El coyote will try to move us across again, tomorrow or the next day or even the next.  It could take two attempts or a dozen. It is all part of the fee.”

“How much?” asked Marco.

“Too much,” said Papa. “It is how it is. Coyotes are a necessary evil.”

"Are they bad?"

Papa sighed. "They are greedy. And money sometimes turns people into monsters."

Marco had heard stories about coyotes, the people who moved Mexicans across the border. Sometimes they took the money from poor peasants, disappeared and left them stranded in Nogales or Tecate with no way home. Coyotes had been known to lead a group into the desert in the summer without enough water where they were later found dead or almost dead, and riddled with cactus thorns. There were the stories about scorpion stings and rattlesnake bites after following a coyote into a dry riverbed. Just last week, Marco overheard a friend of Papa’s tell about a group of people who hid in a truck under a camper shell, bodies piled upon bodies. The Border Patrol tried to stop the truck but the coyote was drunk and tried to speed away. The truck overturned and seventeen Mexicans were killed. Since then, Marco’s thoughts filled with his worst imaginings.

Papa saw the wrinkle in Marco’s forehead and said, “I have always made it across. I would not keep doing this if it was not worth it. I would not do this if it was not the best thing for our family."

Marco nodded. It was the truth. Everything had been better for the family since Papa started crossing. He had not always worked in the United States. When Marco was younger, Papa had gone to work at a large construction site in Guadalajara, thirty miles away from their village of Jocotepec. Six days a week, Papa had carried fifty pound bags of rock and dirt from the bottom of a crater to the top of the hill. All day long, up and down the hill.

Marco had asked him once, "Do you count the times up and down the hill?"

"I do not count," he had answered. "I do not think. I just do it."

Papa’s frustration had grown as the years went by. He was nothing more than un burro, a beast of burden. When the hole in the ground was dug and the big building finished, he had been sent to excavate another hole. And for what? A pitiful five dollars for his nine hours? The day that one of los jefes, the bosses, spat on his father, Papa set the fifty pound bag down and began to walk away.

The boss laughed.“Where are you going?  You need work? You better stay!”

Papa turned around and picked up the heavy bag. He stayed for the rest of the day so that he could collect his pay and to get a ride home, but he never went back.

He told Mama, “My future and the future of my children are marked in stone here. Why not go to the other side? There, I will make fifty dollars a day, maybe more.”

So it had been decided.

For the past three years, Marco had only seen Papa twice a year. He, his mother, and younger sisters moved into a rhythm of existence. He woke with the roosters, went to school in the mornings and helped Mama with Maria, Lilia, and Irma in the afternoon. During harvest, he worked in the corn or chayote fields and counted the days until Papa would come home.

The money orders always preceded Papa. They made Mama happy and they made Papa seem God-like in her eyes. They still did not own a house but now they were able to pay the rent on time and had plenty left over for things like a television and the clothes and games his sisters always wanted. They had money for the market and food, especially for the occasions when Papa came home and Mama cooked meat and sweets every day. 	The first few nights of his homecoming were always the same. Mama made birria, goat stew, and capirotada, bread pudding. Then Papa went out with his compadres to drink and to tell of his work in “Los Estados,” the states. The family would have his company for a month and then he would go back to that unknown place, disappearing on a bus, somewhere beyond the horizon

“What is it like, Papa?” Marco always asked.

“I live in an apartment above a garage with eight messy men. We get up early, when it is still dark to start our work in the flower fields. In the afternoon, we go back to the apartment. We take turns going to the store to buy tortillas, a little meat, some fruit. There is a television so we watch the Spanish stations. We talk about sports and Mexico and our families. There is room on the floor to sleep. On weekends we sometimes play fútbol at the school and drink a few cervezas. Sometimes we have regular work but other times we go and stand on the corner in front of the gas station with the hope we will be picked up by the contractors who need someone to dig a ditch or some other job a gringo will not do. It goes on like this until it is time to come back to Mexico.”

For several years, Marco had begged to go with Papa. His parents finally decided that now that he was twelve, he was old enough to help support the family. With both Marco and Papa working, his sisters might go to the Catholic school.

Mama had cried for three days before they left.  When it was time to board the bus to Guadalajara, he hugged each of his sisters and finally, his mother. "Mama, I will be back.”

“Some come back and some do not," she said, choking back her tears. "You and Papa . . . you are the family's champions."

Marco knew he would return. He already looked forward to his first homecoming, when he would be celebrated like Papa and welcomed like a conquering héroe. As the bus pulled away from Jocotepec, Marco waved from the small window to the women in his family, and for the first time in his life, felt like a man.

*

Marco leaned back on the hard bench on the Tijuana street and closed his eyes.

He already missed Jocotepec and his sisters playing in the corn fields behind the house. He even missed the annoying barking of the neighbor’s dog and Mama’s voice waking him too early for church on Sunday morning when he wanted to sleep.

Papa nudged him. “Stay close to me,” he said, grabbing Marco’s shirt sleeve.

Marco sat up and looked around. There was nothing unusual happening on the street.  What had Papa seen?

A squat, full woman wrapped in a red shawl came down the sidewalk with a determined walk. Marco thought her shape resembled a small Volkswagen. Her blue-black hair was pulled back into a tight doughnut on the top of her head. Heavy make-up hid her face like a painted mask and her red mouth was set in a straight line. As she passed, she glanced at Papa and gave a quick nod.

“Let’s go,” he said.

“That is the coyote?” said Marco. “But it is a woman.”

“Shhh,” said Papa.  “Follow me.”

Marco wove between the tourists on the street, keeping Papa and the marching woman in his sight. She pulled out a cell phone and pressed it to her ear, talking into it as she turned off the main avenue and headed deeper into the town’s neighborhood. Along the way, others seemed to fall in with Papa and Marco until they were a group of eight, five men and three women. Up ahead, the coyote woman waited at a wooden gate built into the middle of the block of apartments. She opened it and signaled for the parade to follow her. They continued through a dirty callejón between two buildings, picking their way around garbage cans until they reached a door in the alley wall.

“In there,” she ordered.

Marco followed Papa inside. It seemed to be a small basement with plaster walls and a cement floor. Narrow wooden stairs escalated one wall to someplace above. A light bulb with a dangling chain hung in the middle of the room and in the corner, a combination television and video player with stacks of children’s video tapes on the floor.

The woman shut the door. “Twelve hundred for each, American dollars."

Marco almost choked. He looked around at the others who appeared to be peasants like him and Papa. Where would they get that kind of money? And how would Papa pay twenty four hundred dollars for the two of them to cross the border?

The transients reached into their pockets for wallets, rolled up pant legs to get to small leather bags strapped around their legs, unzipped inside pouches of jackets and were soon counting bills. Stacks of money appeared. The coyote walked to each person, wrote their names in a notebook, and collected the fees.

In his entire life, Marco had never seen so much money in one room.

“Escucha.  Listen. Since September 11th, I have had trouble trying to get people across with false documents,” she said. "So we will cross in the desert. I have vans and drivers to help. We will leave in the middle of the night. If you need to relieve yourself, there is a bathroom off the alley. You may leave one at a time to buy food at the corner market. The television does not work, only the video.” Her cell phone beeped again. She put it to her ear and listened as she walked up the stairs that groaned and creaked under her weight. Marco heard a door close and a bolt latch.

It was almost dark. Marco and Papa found a spot on the concrete floor near the video player. Marco put his backpack behind him and leaned against it, protecting himself from the soiled wall, where hundreds of heads had rested.

One of the women, who was about Mama’s age, smiled at Marco. The others, tired from their travels, settled on the floor and tried to maneuver their bags for support.  No one said much.

A man next to Papa spoke quietly to him. His name was Javier and he’d been crossing for twelve years. He had two lives, he said. One in the United States and one in his village in Mexico. The first few years of work, he dreamed of the days he would go home to Mexico and his family and now he admitted that he sometimes dreaded his trips back. He wanted to bring his wife and children with him to work and live in the United States but they wouldn’t come. Now, he only went home once a year. What worried him was that he was starting to prefer his life on the other side to his life in Mexico.

Papa nodded as if he understood Javier.

Marco said nothing because he knew that Papa was just being polite. He would never prefer the United States to Mexico.

Marco was too nervous to sleep. He reached over and took several video tapes from the pile. They were all animated movies. He put one in the machine, The Lion King, and turned the volume down low. Trance-like, he watched the lion, Simba, lose his father.

“Hakuna matata,” sang the character on the video. “No worries.”

A series of thoughts paraded through Marco’s mind: the desert, snakes, the possibility of being separated from Papa, the coyote, scorpions. He closed his eyes and the music in the video became the soundtrack of his nightmare.

Hours later, Papa woke Marco. “Now, M’ijo. Let us go.”

Marco let Papa pull him up. He rubbed his eyes and tried to focus on the others who headed out the door.

A man with a flashlight waited until they all gathered in a huddle. Flashlight Man wore all black including his cap, the brim pulled down so far that all that could be seen were his black mustache and small narrow chin.

They picked their way through the alley again, following the direction of the man’s light. At the street, a paneled van waited, the motor running. The door slid open and Marco could see that the seats had been removed to create a cavern. It was already filled with people, all standing up. Men and women held small suitcases and plastic garbage bags next to them filled with their belongings.

There didn’t seem to be an inch of additional space until the flashlight man yelled, “Mueva!”  Move.

The people in the van crammed closer together as each of the group of eight climbed inside.

“Más!” said Flashlight Man. The people tried to squash together. Papa jumped inside and grabbed Marco’s hand, pulling him in, too, but Marco was still half out. The man shoved Marco like he was packing an already stuffed suitcase. The others groaned and complained. The doors slid shut behind Marco. When the van surged forward, no one fell because there was no room to fall. Their bodies nested together, faces pressed against faces, like tightly bundled stalks of celery. Marco turned his head to avoid his neighbor’s breath and found his nose pressed against another’s ear.

The van headed east for a half hour. Then it stopped, the door slid open, and Flashlight Man directed them into the night. His cell phone rang to the tune of “Take Me Out To the Ballgame,” and he quickly answered it.

“One hour. We will be there,” he said to the phone. Then he turned to the small army of people and said, “Let your eyes adjust to the darkness. Then, follow me.”

Marco and Papa held back. They were the last in the group forming the line of obedient lambs walking over a hill and down into a dry arroyo of rocks, dirt and prickly grasses. Visions of snakes and lizards crowded Marco’s mind. He was relieved when they climbed back up and continued to walk over the mostly barren ground. They crossed through a chain link fence where an opening had been cut.

“Are we in the United States,” said Marco.

"Yes," said Papa. “Keep walking.”

The walked along a dirt road for another half hour. In the distance, headlights blinked. Flashlight Man punched a number into his cell phone. The headlights came on again.

“That’s it,” said Flashlight Man and they all hurried toward the van, where they were again sandwiched together inside.

That wasn’t so bad, thought Marco, as the van sped down a dirt road. A tiny bud of relief began to flower in his mind. Hakuna matata. No worries.

Within five minutes, the van slowed to a crawl and then stopped. Marco heard someone outside barking orders at the driver. The van door slid open and four border patrol officers with guns drawn, ordered them out.

Papa whispered to Marco, “La Migra. Immigration officers. Say nothing."

They were herded into two waiting vans with long bench seats.

No one spoke on the ride to the border patrol station. What was there to say? They'd been caught. Inside, it was exactly as Papa had said. They stood in line, gave false names during a short interview, were fingerprinted and released on the Mexico side of the border at the bus station.

“Now what?” asked Marco,

“We walk back to la casa del coyote,” said Papa.

*

It was seven in the morning before they reached downtown Tijuana again. Most shops weren’t open yet and bars and fences enclosed the vendor’s stalls that were filled with pinatas, leather goods, ceramics, and sombreros. Papa bought pre-made burritos and Cokes inside the corner tienda before they turned down the street that led to Coyote Lady’s house.

Many of their group had already found their way back to the basement room off the alley. Papa and Marco found a spot against the wall and fell asleep. They woke late in the afternoon, Papa went to the corner market for food.  Marco watched the video, The Little Mermaid, listening to the fish maiden's song, “Wandering free – wish I could be, part of that world.”

It seemed everyone wanted to go to the other side.

Three days passed with the same routine: Papa going out for food, taking turns to use the bathroom in the alley, sitting and staring and waiting.

On Sunday morning, Coyote Lady came down the stairs into the basement room. She wore a dress like the one Mama wore for church, a floral print with a white collar. Her face was scrubbed clean of make-up and she looked like someone’s aunt or a neighborhood woman from the village.

“Today is a big football game, professional, in San Diego. La Migra will be eager to get people into the U.S. in time for the game. We start moving you in one hour, one at a time."

Marco looked at Papa.  He did not want to be separated from him.

Papa asked, “How?”

“In a car,” said Coyote Lady. “We hide you. If I only take one at a time across, the car does not ride low and look suspicious. I drive in a different  lane each time across. As you can see, we are having trouble with the usual ways, so we try this. It has worked before, especially on a busy day.”

Marco didn’t like the idea of being away from Papa. What happened if Papa got across and he didn’t? Or what if he couldn’t find Papa on the other side? Then what would he do?  He didn’t like this part of the journey. Suddenly, he wished he’d stayed home another year in Jocotepec.

As if reading his mind, Papa said, “I will go before you Marco,” said Papa. “And I will wait for you. I will not leave until you arrive. And if you don’t arrive.  I will come back to this room. That will be the plan if we get separated.”

Marco nodded.

Coyote Lady gave orders and signaled for one of the women to come with her. 	Every hour she stuck her head inside the room and called out another person.

Papa and Marco were the last of the group to go. They walked outside.

In the alley, the trash cans had been pushed aside to make room for an old car. Flashlight Man waited beside the car but he wasn’t wearing his usual black uniform. Instead he had on jeans, a blue and white football jersey and a Chargers cap. He lifted the hood.

Inside, a narrow rectangular coffee table had been placed next to the motor, forming a ledge. Two of the wooden legs disappeared into the bowels of the car and two of the legs had been cut short and now provided the braces against the radiator and motor.

“Okay,” he said. “You lie down in here. It only takes a half hour. There is a van waiting for you in Chula Vista that will take you to your destinations.”

Papa climbed up. Flashlight Man positioned his feet and legs so they would not touch the motor. Papa put his head and upper body on the tiny tabletop, curling his body to make it smaller. For an instant before the hood was closed, Papa’s eyes caught Marco’s, then looked away.

“Vamanos,” said Coyote Lady and she wedged into the driver’s seat. Flashlight Man sat on the passenger side. A Chargers football banner and blue pompoms sat on the dashboard as further proof of their deception. The car backed out of the alley and left.

Marco went back into the basement room and waited.

They had said it would take an hour round trip. The minutes crawled by. Why did Papa agree to do this?  Why did he humiliate himself in front of these people?  Marco walked in circles.

After one hour, he put in the video tape, Aladdin, and tried to pay attention as the characters sang about a whole new world. It seemed so easy in the video to get on a flying carpet to reach a magical place. Where was his is my magic carpet?  Where is the was his new world?  Where was Papa?  Did he get through? Marco had never once heard a story of someone crossing under the hood of a car. He tried to imagine being inside, next to the mechanics of the machinery. His stomach churned.

The door opened. Flashlight Man was back. “Let’s go."

Marco took a deep breath and followed him.

The car was already positioned in the alley with the hood up. Coyote Lady took his backpack and threw it in the trunk. Marco climbed up on the bumper and swung his legs over the motor, then sat on the makeshift ledge.  Flashlight Man arranged Marco’s legs as if he were in a running position, one leg up, knee bent. One leg straighter, but slightly bent. Marco slowly lowered himself on his side and put his head on the tabletop. Then he crossed his arms around his chest and watched the sunlight disappear to a tiny crack as the hood was closed.

“Don’t move in there,” said Flashlight Man.

"I won't," he whispered.

The motor started. The noise hurt Marco's ears and within minutes it was hot. The smell of motor oil and gasoline stung his nostrils. He breathed through his mouth, straining his lips toward the crack in the hood for fresh air. The car moved along for ten minutes until they reached the lanes of traffic that led to the border crossing. Then, it was stop and go. Stop and go. His legs began to cramp but Marco knew not to move one inch.  He tried not to imagine what would happen if he rolled onto the car's motor.

The car lurched and stopped, over and over. Marco wanted to close his eyes but he was afraid that he would feel disoriented. He watched the small crack between the car and hood as if it were his lifeline. A flash of color obliterated his line of sunlight as a flower vendor stopped next to the car trying to make one last sale to Coyote Lady and Flashlight Man. “Flores, flores! You buy cheap! You buy cheap!"

The car started to move forward but the flower vendor continued to walk alongside, tapping on the window. Coyote Lady pressed on the horn. Marco’s body trembled as the sound reverberated through his body. He inched his hands up to cover his ears. The vendor moved away, and the car began to move faster.

Marco never knew when they actually crossed the border. He only knew when the car began to speed up.  His body pulsed with the vibrations of the car. Oddly, he watched  beads of moisture move across the radiator, as if they had the ability to dance.  Marco could not feel his right foot.  It had fallen asleep. Panic crept into his chest and seized his muscles. He slowly pressed his hand back and forth across chest to relieve the tightness.  “No worries,” he whispered. “Hakuna matata. No worries."

*

The car stopped, and a door slammed.

He heard someone fiddling with the hood latch. Light streamed into Marco’s eyes and he squinted. Flashlight Man pulled him from the car, and handed over his backpack. Marco stumbled from his dead foot and his body still rocked with the feeling of the moving car. He looked around. He was in a parking lot behind an auto shop.

Papa was waiting. “We made it,” he said, smiling and clapping Marco on the back. “We are in Chula Vista, California.”

Marco said nothing. He could barely hear what Papa had said because of the noise in his ears. Were they filled with cotton and bees? He felt as if his body had been insulted. He pulled away from Papa and climbed into the waiting van, this one with seats and windows. The door slid shut. Marco looked out the window and saw Coyote Lady and Flashlight Man driving away.

The others in the van smiled and talked as if they’d all just come from a party. The relief of a successful crossing seemed to have unleashed their tongues. Marco listened as they talked of their jobs in towns he’d never hear before: Escondido, Solana Beach, Poway, Cardiff.  Papa told them that he and his son were going to Encinitas to work in the flower fields and that it was his son’s first time crossing over. Faces turned toward Marco.

Marco cringed, embarrassed, and stared at his shoes.

One of the men laughed out loud. “At least you were not rolled inside a mattress like I was on my first time!”

“Or like me,” said a young woman, grinning. “They dressed me as an abuelita, a grandmother, with a wig and old clothes and had me walk across with another woman’s identification. I was shaking the entire time.”

Marco looked up and forced a smile.

Stories spilled from their lips about their first times, or their friend’s, or family member’s: hiding inside hollowed out bales of hay, cramped inside a hide-a-bed sofa in which the bed frame had been removed, buried in the middle of a truckload of crates filled with cackling chickens. Marco found himself laughing and nodding. He felt giddy as they reveled in each other’s bizarre and sometimes life-threatening stories. And began to feel proud and somehow connected to the people in the van. When one man told how he was hidden in a door panel of a truck, smashed in a fetal position for one hour and thought he might suffocate, Marco laughed the hardest.

As the people were dropped off in towns along the way north, they shook hands with Marco and Papa and left them with the same words, “Buena suerte,” good luck.  When Papa and Marco were the only ones left in the van and the driver finally headed up Freeway 5 toward Encinitas, Papa grinned at him. “Okay?”

Marco nodded. “Okay.”  He looked out the window at the people in the cars on the freeway. And wondered how many of them were headed to a whole new world.
