“So there’s this place in Ironbound I know we can cop them,” Che said. He’s a fast talker, that one. All elastic lips and no form. He said he knows a guy that sells them cheap bro, dirt cheap. It’ll barely cost you anything, he said. He was like that a lot. All hot air and no balloon. He said they’ll give you the best stuff, right off the truck, for close to nothing. And it’ll feel like you’re holding forever in your hands. “*Pues* like you gotta go right now and get it,” he said. Before it’s too late. Before it’s all gone.

My feet dangled off the ledge, decorating the front of Heller’s Pharmacy like run down sneakers noosed over a telephone line as I tried to make sense of what he was on about. The snow bit through my worn-out jeans, water wriggling its way down my thigh and pooling at the hem.  Drips loosened from the pants, pitter-patter-pitter-pattered themselves dead flat on the “r” in the sign that only flickered half-heartedly above the entrance to the drugstore.

I felt him stir to me, agitated by the silence. He wanted me to answer – and I knew he does, of course I knew what he wanted – but I didn’t say anything. The seconds drowned in the patter beneath my feet.

“Pero *pendejo*, did you hear me? Are we going to do this or not?” He said this breathless, as though the thought had angrily fought its way passed his lips just to sit pretty in the air between us. Dark brown eyes dug into my own earnestly.

My hand twitched a bit when he talked to me. He didn’t see it, but I did. And it scared the hell out of me.

“Don’t you remember the last time we went there Che? Jennilee had to get her cousin to pick her up because it got weird, and I think I jumped over like fifteen fences just to get far enough away from that mess. I don’t feel like doing that today,” I said, stiffening. The windchimes below jostled; someone had entered the pharmacy below. “And why do you even need to get more? Didn’t we get enough last time?”

“Oh, the last one we picked up just went away like that.” He snapped. “You know how it goes.”
And I did.

It was a bad habit I had to kick, hanging out with him. Every afternoon the two of us would come and sit on the roof to shoot the shit and throw snowballs at the 27 bus when it makes its way down the block. I told myself we did it because it helps pass the time. Mami was cleaning houses until the bleach washes the Caribbean out of her skin and Papi’s hands flapped like metal *murcielagos* at the factory until the crack of dawn laid them down to sleep. Without them, the clock ticked mean in the apartment like police sirens. It drove me insane, so I stayed out of the apartment until I couldn’t see my hands outstretched before me.

But that wasn’t all true. It was something about the way passengers notice the snowballs only sometimes that brought me to the ledge, had let the adrenaline take root in my knees. They’re a little far away, but still I could see it – the way they turned and looked at me, eyes stiff, wide and unblinking. The way I could almost make out my reflection in their silhouette in the window as the bus sped down the hill.  The way their eyes held mine, saw through them for just for a moment, and then were gone.

He stopped suddenly and, me being me lost in the monsoon of my thoughts, stumbled clumsily into him, nose pressing slightly into the soft nape of his neck. “Angelo, *muévete*! Back up, let me go ahead first and see if the place is clear. Just – just hang back for a bit, okay?”

I blinked away the feeling of him, mumbled something like sorry and readjusted. He was already four steps ahead, the headlights passing by on the street intermittently outlining the recklessness in his frame in the dark as he headed to the top of the hill. Once he reached the fences, he began to weave in and out of the chain links. With ease, Che planted himself on the other side of the gate and began to make his across the empty lot towards the lone car parked in the back, hugging the side of a brick building. I waited until he was a good distance away until I grasped the fence and hauled myself up as well.

The view from the top seemed promising: Newark’s skyline unfolded below in rows of bricks, shoddy bodegas and corner stores of the Ironbound part of the city bleeding into one another in grayscale. Past the centerfold of the city, New York’s lights hummed brightly in the darkening sky. From this angle, there didn’t seem to anything more between them than a few blocks, a handful of stone’s throws away from buildings I couldn’t see the top of, even if I craned my neck all the way back. For a moment, I stayed there perched, wondering how long people would continue to look up at it without ever finding the end. The light in the sky stretched thin before it disappeared altogether.

A whistle pierced the silence, and I knew that was my cue. Hopping off the fence, my feet pressed down hard on the cracked concrete, and I leaned into my sneakers hard, hands pressed down flat on the ground to steady myself. I got up and followed Che’s steps across the lot with my hands stinging, bits of gravel having bitten graves into my palm. I curled them up slightly, cupping them in place for a bit before letting them fall back to the ground like raindrops.
The window rolled down as I approached the car, and a pair of piercing, older eyes peaked over the cracked window, trailing lazily down the length of me. “You look familiar.” He paused, pulling at the ends of his white do-rag, and I watched the realization spread across his face like a street lamp, flickering. “*’pérate*, *‘pérate* - Are you Jennilee’s friend?”

Che, sitting in the passenger seat, grabbed the man’s headrest. “Yeah, yeah, that’s the friend I was telling you about. He’s good.” He tossed his head backwards, gesturing to me. “Get in.” I looked to the man, and he didn’t seem to disagree. Instead, he pulled a lighter out of his pocket and flicked it alive, pinching the fire absentmindedly, as if he didn’t care that we were even there. The cross hanging from the chain around his neck swayed over the flame.
The scene inside wasn’t promising: I stepped gingerly over ashen cigarette buds and a Jackson Pollock of dark smudges on the beige interior and folded myself small into the backseat.

“How’s Jennilee doing?” The man called back to me without looking up. I shifted. “Um, good I think.”

“Tell her I was looking for her when you see her, alright?”

“Got it.” I knew I wouldn’t. Jennilee was shaken up from the first time we met with him. He had his hand on her thigh for almost the entire time. Later that week, she told me in rushed whispers between the aisles at Heller’s that after I had left, she tried to catch Che’s attention so he could say something, but he had looked at her and didn’t say a word. He just kept acting tough, she said, even making jokes to the man about her like they hadn’t grown together all their lives, like she wasn’t right there. She had this wild look on her face when she told me that her hair stands up whenever she thinks about it.

“You do that *papi*.” The man nodded to himself, flames dancing in his eyes. “You do that.”

Che’s thumb ran roughly across his forefinger, flexing and clenching his hand behind the headrest. I knew this means he was nervous, that he was trying to relax himself, and I wished I could have just reached out and grabbed his hand, to have let him know that everything will be fine. But I knew better than to do that, especially there.

It was dark out by then, so the only light in the car came from the intermittent shines bouncing off the nearby road and the man’s lighter. With this, I saw him catch my eye in the rearview mirror, and he cleared his throat, returning to their original conversation. “*Pues*, like I was saying, we sold the batch we bought last week, and were wondering if we could get the next one early this time.” He was looking at the man, but I knew that wasn’t what he was seeing.

The man continued to play with the fire, unfazed. Che continued, talking fast. “It was a hit, man, all the kids at school were throwing money at me.” This wasn’t true: He had bought all the first package’s content for himself. He called it getting to know your products – an investment, he said – then called me a *pendejo* when I asked if he needed to buy all of them to do that. “They sold so fast, they just couldn’t get enough of your stuff.” Another lie.

“So if it was so popular, where’s my money?”

His body jerked. “Oh yeah, yeah. My bad, it’s right here.” He handed the man a neat roll of bills, secured by an elastic.

The man unraveled it, thumbing swiftly through them.

Satisfied, he banded the bills together again. “You can take two sets this time. Take the larger bag in the glove compartment. The pay up front for this one is $150, clean. You can keep whatever else you make on it.”

Che hesitated. “That’s, that’s real nice of you, but I was good with the way we had it last time. I don’t mean to turn down your offer, but it’s just that I gotta take the bus home later, and the electricity bill’s due this month, and –“
“Listen, I didn’t ask for your life story. You either take it or leave it.” The lighter was back, but this time the man wasn’t even paying attention to the fire – he was looking straight at Che.

Che turned to me, and a car passed by us. For a moment I caught a glimpse of hesitation. “Can you spot me some cash?” he asked me. I shook my head no, and his face steeled, brows knitting in confusion.

I felt my cheeks getting hot. Are you serious? he mouthed, and my gaze fell against his lips, those tiny pink roses being pulled thinner and thinner, and I shook my head slower this time. I knew how things were at home for him. He can’t afford this kind of money then. It was the winter, and his father, a construction worker, was out of work for the season, so his mother had taken double shifts for the past three weeks straight to put food on the table for him and his sisters. This was best for him then. He might not have realized it in that moment, but I did. Please? his lips parted, and I felt myself beginning to sweat.

The man shot a quick glance at me and then turned back to Che. “Well, it looks like your business partner just fell through *chacho*.” He gripped the steering wheel tough with his right hand, creating a barrier between them.  “If you’re not gonna buy the stuff, you can just get out. Call me up when you’re ready to stop wasting my time.” His eyes fell back onto the road past the empty parking lot. Another car passed by, and for a moment I thought I could see the gate I had scaled to get into the lot. But the car passed, and the view passed the front window returned to the muffled glow of the city somewhere far enough away.

“He was just kidding, just joking around! He’s just funny like that.” Che was getting frantic, the nerves creeping noticeably into his voice. He threw his hands into the air. This did nothing to get the man’s attention. He turned back to me. “Angelo, tell him. You’re definitely in this with me. Right, *Angelito*?” His voice picked up on the last note, calling me the way my mother used to when she was feeling softer.

My face was on fire, hot and squirming under his stare, but I didn’t turn away. I looked at him, and he was looking at me he was really looking at me, and it didn’t matter than we were in this shady car with the light a few miles away from where I could hold it because I knew he was finally seeing me, for real this time.

Slowly, I felt myself coming undone, like a loose stitch being pulled, unraveling me raw. I grabbed onto the seat, trying to make myself as still as possible. He pulled in his bottom lip out of worry, folding it under his teeth like a crushed petal, waiting for me to reply, and I felt myself wither away.

Che’s always had these wild plans: First we were supposed to make it big selling the stuff, dominating our slice of the neighborhood, making a huge profit off the ridiculously upshot street price he proposed we push it for. I think the gringos would call this hyperinflation or something, I told him, but he shrugged it off. Then we shoot straight up to the top of the food chain here *chacho*, he said. There were no other steps for him. Everyone’ll know our names by the end of this all, he said. The neighborhood kids will look up to us. They’ll respect us, he said, eyes kinda glazed over and soft, looking straight ahead and nowhere at the same time. “We won’t have to ask no one for nothing,” he thought aloud, voice low and steady, hanging in the air just so.

We were back on the ledge again, and the streetlights were casting a dim light on the sidewalk beneath our feet, just enough for us to make out the tops of familiar heads bobbing back and forth past the pharmacy. The package sat pretty in the space between us, swaddled conspicuously in a brown paper bag and saran wrap as if it was a fragile little thing. Both of us looked towards the street, watched the traffic build up and people stressing in their cars because of the wait. Neither of us touched what was between us.

The “r” flickered beneath us. He turned to me. “Pero *pendejo*, did you hear me? We’re going to be the kings of this place, you and me. Can’t you see it?” I watched him stretch his arms out wide, holding the city in his wingspan. My breath caught in my throat, tangled itself in between heartstrings.

I still tell myself that I believed him. I knew he wanted to hear me say it – of course I knew what he wanted – but maybe I shouldn’t. Maybe I should have told him how I really felt – that I thought this plan of his is going to fall apart and that we were going to be the same kids doing the same old thing, with no one looking at us any different, less $150. That we were still going to be sitting on this ledge every afternoon and every night, watching the heat waves dance in the summer and shaping snowballs in the winter, our hands on the ledge still only finger-spaces away from each other, never getting any closer. That we would end up going home to our separate apartments, graze past our parents only briefly, and fall asleep to the sound of sirens crying. That nothing would ever change. That I knew this much will be true.

But despite all this, I couldn’t go back now. I told him I could see it too.

This relaxed him, and he puts his hand on my shoulder. I sucked in my breath sharp, hoping that he didn’t notice. He left it there for a bit. “Thanks for always having my back. You’re a true brother to me, *hermano*.”

Something in me shifted. It was small, almost imperceptible. Like the gliding of tectonic plates, moving mere breaths apart from each other, And yet, I felt it ripple down to my toes.

Instinctively, I pulled away. He looked at me surprised, even a little hurt I thought. I opened my mouth say something when a windchime patters beneath our feet. We both turned our attention to the sound and saw a familiar silhouette leaving the store, making its way up the block.

Che jumped up, got away from the ledge and steadied himself on the roof. “That’s Jennilee! We’ve gotta catch up to her and tell her that guy’s looking for her.” The moment had passed for him, and he rushed to make his way to the fire escape to catch her. “Jennilee!” he shouted in her general direction. “Wait up!”

In a second, he was gone. Jennilee had stopped at the corner, and I saw her watching him, waiting for him to catch up and greet her. She was the kind of girl that guys would run their hearts out for, and Che was no different. He caught up to her and they embraced. When they began to talk, he left his hand resting on her shoulder the entire conversation.

I felt my leg jolt, but I stayed on the ledge, letting my feet drift lazily above the “r”, which had stopped flickering when I wasn’t looking. Patiently, I waited, hoping to see the light dance one more time beneath my soles before I decided to go after him.

Outside the window, the world moved fast. Shops blurred into houses into corners, and new neighborhoods blended in with the old ones. Sometimes the 27 bus moved so fast that I couldn’t make out the details of strangers’ faces on the sidewalk. The cloak of night outside didn’t help either; I had to peer intently past my own reflection in the window just to make out anything at all. The most I could see was the snow that traced the sidewalk, browning at the edge from gas exhausts and car emissions, and the faint whisper of red hats, long brown hair, the hint of dark, piercing eyes looking back at me. But I couldn’t really tell whether that was outside or was just a part of my reflection.

Che was falling asleep next to me. His head bobbed up and down as he tried unconsciously to fight off the wave of exhaustion from that day’s haul, but nature had the upper hand. He struggled with it for a little bit longer, but after a little while I felt his head drifting backward in the plastic seats, falling into the blue head cushion. Mouth slightly ajar, he stayed there, unsteady.

The stuff rolled out of his hoodie pocket. There must have been a hole in the saran wrapping, because its contents tumbled into the gap between our thighs. Counterfeit watches clinked and clattered unto the seat, their faces boring holes into mine.

I quickly surveyed my surroundings: The bus was relatively empty. Save for an older woman in a colorful knitted hat clutching her purse, there was no one else in the vicinity that noticed. I began to try and hide the stuff – he had paid too much for these to get stolen just like that – but suddenly, Che’s head rolled gently onto my shoulder, and my hands stuttered, rippled.

I tried to shift him off, but a soft murmur trickled out from between his lips and it stopped me. I wanted to check and see if his eyes were open, to ask him if he was trying to say something to me, but I didn’t dare move anymore again, lest it woke him. We had quite a ways to go – I’d pick them up before we got off.

We sat like that the whole ride back, him on my shoulder and my eyes glued to the window, waiting to see if any kids like us were out there, molding snowballs with their worn-out gloves, waiting to catch a stranger’s eyes and hold it there for a fleeting second or so before they vanished.
