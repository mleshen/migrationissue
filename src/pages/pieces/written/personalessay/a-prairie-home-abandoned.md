It was on the midway at the Central Wyoming Fair and Rodeo, holding a Reserve Champion ribbon for my skirt and blouse, sulking and picking at a funnel cake, when I accused my mother of not knowing how to sew. Angrily, I added, "Why can't you be like other mothers?" She took the ribbon from me. "I do sew," my mother said. And then she told me about her British teacher Mrs. Piggott, who had taught her 40 years before in India. I had never heard about her, instead, I liked stories set firmly in the West. 

Growing up in Wyoming, I idolized Ma Ingalls in the *Little House on the Prairie* books. Ma could make a sod house warm and comfortable. Ma made dolls out of flour sacks and taught her daughter Laura to make an intricate Dove-in-the Window quilt. Ma let them roast a pig's tail. She had a garden and sewed all their clothes. My own mother bought our clothes at the mall. She didn't allow pork in the house, and mostly cooked curry. The only fabric I thought she knew was the 6-yards of cloth of the saris she wore most days.

When I was 12, determined to learn the skills of a good homemaker, I joined 4-H, which to me, was a more practical version of girl scouts. Our group was called the "Baker's Dozen" and all year we learned a fairly antiquated set of skills -- we baked bread, sewed, made preserves, and cross-stitched. Our goal as we worked through the winter always loomed ahead -- the County Fair in the summer, and if we did well, the State Fair. At every meeting, our leader taught us domestic skills and led us in the 4-H  pledge -- *I pledge my head to clearer thinking, My heart to greater loyalty, My hands to larger service, and my health to better living, for my club, my community, my country, and my world.* And every week when I went home, I grumbled that my mother didn't know how to bake cookies, she didn't quilt or crochet. She was no pioneer like Ma, which for me, was a source of embarrassment. My heart clearly wasn't very loyal.

Earlier in the Spring, she had agreed to bring the snacks for a children's choral group that I sang in. Most mothers ran to the store and came in with large jugs of fruit punch and packages of cookies. My mother painstakingly made samosas for 50 children. I was so proud of this until the first friend took a bite then spat it out claiming it was too spicy. After that I asked her to bring cookies next time like all the other mothers, although I knew how hard she had worked.

That summer, at the Central Wyoming Fair and Rodeo, I won Reserve Champion in Fabric and Fashion for making a skirt and blouse. It was a simple outfit made of calico with yellow daisies patterned on it. I had spent the Spring carefully sewing straight stitches and redoing the yoke of the shirt several times. I worked at my 4-H leader's house, and my mother never saw the outfit until I walked down the makeshift runway in the fashion show in the arena at the fairgrounds. And afterwards as we walked around eating fry bread and funnel cakes, I finally snapped at her. My stomach sick with fried food, riding roller coasters, and the feeling that my mom wasn't like other mothers. 

"Why can't you sew?" I shouted.

Standing in the middle of the noisy fair, my mother explained how growing up in Chennai, she went to an Anglo-Indian school. She was just seven when India became independent, and her school was still a holdover from British times. Many of the teachers were British, and each Indian girl in her class when she was my age took Domestic Science. From British ladies, they learned to "manage a home," in the British way.

Week after week, they learned to do things that their counterparts in England were learning, despite the absurdities. My mother learned how to make a Madeira Cake when at home she had no oven. They learned how to whip eggs and then to make a blancmange. They made calf's-foot jelly in case they needed to feed an invalid, when she and most of the other girls never touched beef at home.  They were taught to make a bed with a top sheet and how to make crisp hospital corners, when at home, she slept on a reed mat. She learned to sew a nightdress from an old McCall's pattern book when at home she slept in a half sari. She learned how to do a complete Spring and Summer cleaning, how to air a room, and how to make a mustard poultice.

My mother had been holding my pink ribbon and she handed it back to me. "It's good you know how to sew. Your outfit is beautiful. It's good to have skills. You'll never know when you'll need them."  

My mother had come a long way from living in India to stand with me at a county fair in Wyoming. She had skills she never would use, and many that as time went on, she would learn and adapt for her new life in America. She would learn to make us spaghetti, to drive me to ski practice, even help me make my waterbed.

At that time, I thought I wanted to live like Laura Ingalls Wilder, although I realized years later we'd probably never be friends since I was brown. I had some notion of homemaking that having fresh cake, handmade clothes, and jam made for a happy life. It would be years later that I would read how life was rather awful for many pioneer women. And for me to realize my mother was a new kind of pioneer, going West in a different way, making a home somewhere far from her known world. She wasn't Ma, but making do in all the same ways.
