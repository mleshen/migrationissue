The women asked:

"What time is it?"

"Are we still in August?"

Others said:

"I've lost track of time since my son and I got locked up in here."

"I was separated from my children on June 9th. I don't know how many days have passed."

Like in any incarceration space, time moves at a strange pace in the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, the largest immigrant family detention center in the United States. The center is run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and CoreCivic, the private prison corporation contracted by the federal government to manage nearly 63% of the immigrant jails in the USA. It's one of the many immigration detention spaces in the country's rapidly expanding industrial prison complex. 

The USA is the country with the largest immigration detention infrastructure in the world, detaining between 380,000 and 442,000 persons each year, and maintaining a daily bed quota of 34,000 immigrants (a number that the White House has requested to increase to 51,000 in 2018). The detention center at Dilley has a capacity for 2,400 people, all of whom are women with children, and most of whom are from countries of the Northern Triangle (Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala). Despite the laws that rule that a detention center that incarcerates children "shall not be equipped internally with major restraining construction or procedures typically associated with correctional facilities," the Dilley detention center is a jail --and is in fact known, colloquially, as "baby jail." No physical contact is allowed beyond a handshake, and, although detainees and guards know the water in the facility is contaminated, volunteers are not allowed to offer clients bottled water. 

While their particular circumstances and stories vary, women and their children held in the Dilley facility have one thing in common: they fled circumstances of unspeakable violence in their home countries, came to seek legal protection in the United States, and were detained in a federal prison complex while they hope to be granted due process. The majority of women and children currently being held in the Dilley detention center arrived in the United States in the early summer of 2018, after the Zero Tolerance Policy was enacted and family separations began. 

The news of family separation traveled around the world that summer, haunting the minds of millions with leaked sound footage and brutal images of children being torn away from their parents and put inside cages. After a generalized, public outcry, as well as an eighteen-state lawsuit against the government, President Trump signed an Executive Order on June 20th, putting an end to family separation (though he failed to detail plans for reunification and the deadline for reuniting all families was not met). Since then, media coverage of the situation of Central American asylum seekers dwindled, as did public attention; and then it suddenly surged again, with the news of the second Migrant Caravan, which left Honduras on October 13th and is on its way to the US border. 

But what has happened in the meantime? Between this past summer and now, the current administration has been working on making a series of policy changes and amendments to laws---such as the ongoing effort to end the Flores Settlement, which sets basic national standards for incarceration spaces for minors, or to rescind the "Matter of A.B.", which concerns women who are victims of domestic violence who may be eligible for asylum. Most of these changes and amendments are made so swiftly and are so technical, that for the general public it is practically impossible to keep up. 

The lives of the mothers still detained in Dilley --as the lives of those in other detention spaces across the country and of those who are yet to arrive and who will most likely be incarcerated-- remain uncertain. They are used as grist in the baffling spectacle of political violence that the Trump administration successfully prime-times in worldwide media every now and then. But their fates also depend on this administration's less visible, more constant and equally bewildering bureaucratic violence --one waged on paper, through policy memoranda and amendments to immigration law. Because this much seems clear by now about the Trump Administration's modus operandi: while they wage loud, "shock-doctrine" attacks against minority groups, such as family separation, or the assault on immigrant caravans, they also proceed with another --more silent, surreptitious-- bureaucratic war against them. It is this second war that is perhaps ultimately more toxic, as its media presence is more ephemeral, but its effects more long-lasting. If we hope to see a reform in the immigration system that entails a dismantling of its connection to the industrial prison complex --and the systematic, highly lucrative confinement of bodies, the majority of them black and brown-- it is crucial that we look beyond the moments in which a situation of crisis reaches a peak, and continue to document and denounce the normalized, day-to-day forms of institutional violence.

In the visitation trailer at the Dilley detention center, volunteers interview women in order to help them prepare for their "credible fear interview" with asylum officers. This is the first formal step toward being granted legal protection and refugee status in the USA. The volunteers who prepare women for their credible fear interviews have to be cleared by ICE and approved by the Dilley Pro Bono Project (DPBP), a project of the Immigration Justice Campaign. A long line forms in front of the registration sheet where each volunteer and DPBP staff member receives a CoreCivic badge with an ID number on it. As volunteer attorneys, legal interns, and staff shuffle through the visitation trailer every morning, detainee women and their kids are lined up on one side of the entrance. The CoreCivic guards --sometimes patient, and other times cruel in their manner-- remind the mothers and children to stand in line and keep quiet. Children who speak indigenous languages, even though they wear badges that say, "I speak Mixteco," or "I speak Q'eqchi'" are given instructions in English or sometimes Spanish, and are often scolded when they do not understand them.

   The right to seek and be granted asylum in a foreign territory was articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, signed in 1948, in the aftermath of WWII by forty-eight of the then fifty-eight-member States of the United Nations. The 1951 Convention & Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees subsequently defined the term "refugee" more specifically, as "an individual who is outside his or her country of nationality or habitual residence who is unable or unwilling to return due to a well-founded fear of persecution based on his or her race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group." The 1951 Convention also lay forth the basic principles and rights that a refugee should be afforded, though the exact asylum proceedings and refugee status specificities were left for each country to determine, according to their domestic laws and circumstances.

In the United States, for example, any person seeking refugee status is usually first screened by an asylum officer, who will conduct a credible fear interview to determine whether the person fulfills all the conditions for asylum. If the officer determines the person is eligible, the next step is to sign release papers with ICE. If the asylum officer decides the asylum seeker's fear is "not credible" they will receive a negative decision followed by an "expedited removal proceeding" (immediate deportation order). The decision can be appealed, but for a detainee to successfully appeal it in immigration court he or she needs an attorney, and there isn't always one available or willing to work pro bono.

That is where pro bono organizations step in, preparing asylum seekers for their credible fear interview, and garnering the support of volunteer attorneys and legal interns who can become legal representatives for incarcerated people. Preparation for the credible fear interview consists of several steps. But, since asylum law is centered on fear of persecution on account of "race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group," the objective of the preparation in Dilley is to understand what type of persecution a woman suffered, what kind of persecution she fears if she were forced to return to her home country, if she ever reported persecution to the police or other government authorities, why she cannot relocate to another part of her own country; and finally, if her persecution is linked to her belonging to a "particular social group" (the most common asylum qualifier for women fleeing gang and domestic violence in Central America).

After initial biographical questions (name, date of birth, national origin, languages spoken, medical conditions, schooling, race and ethnicity, religion, marital status and names and dates of birth of children), women are asked about their fear of persecution.

To the question "Have you ever been threatened or hurt by anyone in your home country?" women almost invariably reply:

"Yes."

The questions proceed:

"Who threatened you?"

"MS-13 gang-members. Barrio 18 gang-members. The police. My husband. My partner. My boyfriend. My children's father."

"What did he do?" or "What did they do?"

"They beat me. He raped me. He said they were going to kill me."

"Why did they target you specifically?"

"Because I resisted his advances. Because I didn't want to hide the guns. Because I didn't vote for the party they told me to vote for. Because I look this way."

When a seventeen-year-old girl and her mother, both from El Salvador, arrived at the preparation interview in the visitation trailer, the girl asked for water. As she sipped from a paper cup of tap water, she said:

"I just want you to know that I didn't want to come here. I had a good life and I was about to graduate from high school, but now I missed my chance of getting my diploma."

Her gaze was steady, intelligent, and her voice soft but firm.

"Why did you leave your country?"

"Because members of the MS-13 gang threatened to kill me."

"Did they hurt you?

"No, they never hurt me. They only threatened me."

"Why did they threaten you?"

After a silence, she explained that she was threatened to death by the MS-13 because one of the gang members wanted to date her and she refused, and because they wanted her to sell drugs for them, and she had also refused. In a way, her problems were not too dissimilar from those of many other 17-year-olds --drugs, dates-- except, in her case, consequences were life-threatening. The MS-13 said they would kill her and her mother if they did not comply with their demands, and everyone knows that the MS-13 carries out its threats without thinking twice. They were detailed in their threat and told her mom:

"We will throw your daughter's body in a black plastic bag in the palm tree next to your house."

The particular details and circumstances vary, but what the stories that women tell at the Dilley visitation trailer have in common is the systemic abuse and violence perpetrated against them by the men in their communities, their homes, as well as in the public institutions in their countries. As the journalists Óscar Martínez and Juan José Martínez explain in their forthcoming book about the MS-13, Niño de Hollywood (forthcoming from Verso Books in 2019), women are seen by the MS-13 gang not only as expendable and disposable, but also as a nuisance to a member's commitment to the pandilla, clica, or gang. Women are "an obstacle to achieving gang-purity" that "stands in the way between the pandillero and his full commitment to the clica." The only form of participation that women have in the MS-13 is as jainas (girlfriends or wives of gang members). Women who have MS-13 family members --a brother, uncle or a cousin-- also run the risk of being targeted by opposing gangs because of the affiliation of those relatives to the MS-13. Gang rape, death threats, and prolonged psychological and physical abuse are the everyday reality that women recount during their preparation interviews.

Volunteer attorneys and legal assistants have to gather as many details about the abuses suffered in order to understand how those abuses may qualify women for asylum:

"How many men were there?"                                          

"Did they have weapons?"                                    

"How close were they to your body?"                                                                   

"How do you know they are capable of killing you and getting away with it?"

"Have there been other women like you that were killed because of this?"

"Do you fear they will carry on their threat if you return to your country?"

"Did they also threaten to kill your children?"

"Did they say this to you explicitly?"

"How do the authorities react to these crimes?"

"Did you report this to the police?"

"Why not?"                               

In an overwhelming majority of cases, when asked this last question, women reveal that they either did not report the crime to the police, due to fear of further consequences, or that they did, but the police simply did not intervene. One woman explained, during her interview:

"We didn't go to the police because we knew they would tell the gang. They work together to keep us under their eye. Even if you know a woman is locked up in her house, and she yells when she gets beaten, you can't go to the police."

One may ask, then: if so many women are being threatened to death, raped, abused, and sometimes killed by gang members --some of whom are their own relatives-- and authorities in their countries are not doing anything about it, why is it so difficult for them to get asylum? Why does asylum law not protect them?

The answer to this is complicated, but it all basically boils down to one fact: asylum parameters in the United States are very narrow and jurisprudence has typically denied gender alone as a qualifier for a "particular social group" and the fact that that gender-based violence (domestic and or gang-related) is not seen as linked to state violence. Over the years, lawyers have found ways to argue why women in certain circumstances --for example, women afraid of persecution who live in a country where the government fails to protect their fundamental human rights-- may indeed qualify as belonging to a "particular social group." Some examples of this kind of litigation in the USA are linked to the so-called "Matter of A-B-" and "Matter of ARCG," (AB and ARCG are the initials of the women by which a legal precedent was set for cases involving women fleeing domestic violence). It is through "matters" like ARCG's that lawyers have been able to argue, over the past few years, that women who are seen as property, are constantly abused, and are unable to leave their spousal relationship qualify as belonging to a "particular social group" and are therefore eligible for asylum.

However, the progress that attorneys and judges had accomplished over the years in widening the very narrow asylum window for women suffering circumstances of brutal violence, were overruled on July 11, 2018. This was done through one of those "silent and invisible" policy changes, in a memorandum issued by Attorney General Sessions titled "Guidance for Processing Reasonable Fear, Credible Fear, Asylum, and Refugee Claims in Accordance with Matter of A-B." The new policy narrows the definition of what constitutes a "particular social group" and who is or is not eligible for asylum, and it explicitly excludes women fleeing "domestic violence" and "gang violence" from asylum-eligibility. But, of course, it just so happens that the thousands of Central American women and children seeking asylum in the USA are doing so precisely on the grounds of an intersection (or a collision, rather) of gang and domestic violence, in countries where the government cannot and will not hold persecutors accountable, or where state actors are complicit or even direct perpetrators of such violence.

The asylum-seeking mother is a woman who flees her country with her children because, from the moment she is born, she exists in a context where society punishes her for being a woman, for being poor, for being indigenous or mestiza, for being a single mother, for being a victim of sexual violence, for being politically active, for being a business owner, etcetera. She is born into a context where her society and her government do not seek to protect her wellbeing, she is abused constantly, and she runs the daily risk of being killed. Otherwise, she would not have fled. The larger problem underlying all this is that society and governments fail to recognize domestic violence as a symptom of a wider and deeper societal and political violence against women. Women living in poverty and violence, in post-conflict contexts marked by a deeply entrenched patriarchal system are simply seen as expendable both to the State and to society. This kind of context is the perfect Petri dish for femicidal States --where a society and the government collaborate constantly, either by action or inaction, to remind women that their lives do not matter. The only option for women in these circumstances, if they want to live, is to flee.

Most women detained in Dilley did not suspect that on the other side of the border they would find more violence, more threats, and indefinite imprisonment.

During a preparation interview, a woman said:

"We crossed through the river, they had clothes for us to change but they purposefully left us wet and freezing in the hielera [icebox]. Even the children. They all got eye infections, colds, and diarrhea."

And another:

"Everything you see in the news is true because I am living it. When the volunteers came to the perrera, they had signs that said 'We love you! Welcome to America!' They were all crying. All the mothers and children in the bus started crying, too. Not out of joy, but because the volunteers and the protesters seemed very worried, and that scared us. Nobody told us where we were going. We thought we were going to get deported. Then they put us in here. I don't know for how long."

Asylum law is currently under siege in the United States of America. And whatever may be the deeper --racial, cultural or ideological-- motivations for barring asylum seekers from due process, the immediate results of this administration's policies are clear: an increase in the federal budget assigned to Homeland Security (and specifically to ICE), an increase in border security, an increase in the daily quota of detainees, and possibly more importantly, an increase in the construction of new immigration detention spaces. Detaining undocumented bodies is simply one of the most lucrative industries in the business of governing the USA.

The circumstances that lead to displacement of undocumented families from their countries, the framing of immigration as a national security issue instead of a human rights problem, the criminalization of asylum-seekers and immigrants, and the profit from incarcerating them merge seamlessly into the perfect scenario for mass immigration detention. How far this administration is willing to go --willing to terrorize, separate, incarcerate, deport, tear apart childhood and parenthood, and ultimately break the psyche of as many asylum-seeking immigrants as possible-- in order to widen and strengthen an already alarmingly robust industrial prison complex still remains to be seen.

After 22 days in the detention center one young woman said:

"I won't keep begging because it becomes more and more humiliating."

Another woman said:

"I feel caged here. Wherever you look there is someone watching you. But this is paradise compared to the perrera [cages]. There, we had to sleep in colchones [mattresses] smeared with poop and pee and vomit. They didn't let us brush our teeth."

Another woman said:

"I told them at the perrera I would sign my deportation, I am not a criminal to be treated this way. I have never felt so resentful. I cry when I am asleep."

And another:

"They put eight vaccines in my daughter, back to back. Now she can't move her arms."

And yet another:

"Some of us get together and tell stories and laugh. When we laugh it is not joy we feel. We are just trying to survive. We daydream of escaping this place through the toilet."

When asked if she ever regretted coming to the United States, a young woman answered:

          "Now I regret it, a thousand times. I think I'd rather die of one gunshot in my own country than let them kill me slowly in this one."
