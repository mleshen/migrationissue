"Why do you ever come back, then, at all?" he demanded of the swallows jealously. "What do you find to attract you in this poor drab little country?" 

                                                                       -The Wind in the Willows, Kenneth Grahame

Trivandrum is a city- but just barely. It is not the kind of place that you associate with the word 'city'. It is perhaps better described as a tiny town in the southernmost state of India: Kerala. 

Afternoons are not so much sleepy as comatose. There is no activity on the road come nightfall. There are no flash cars nor flash nightclubs: anyone young must content themselves with coffeeshop dates and walks in the quiet lanes. There is precious little to do other than gossip, call on your neighbors, and eat plate after plate of beef fry and parotta at your local thattukada (the cheap street food vendors that abound in every city in India). 

This, then, was where I grew up in the 1990s (a time in which my Friday night entertainment consisted of borrowing books from the local library and borrowing DVDs from the local video shop). There might have been another, more exciting Trivandrum, but I was not privy to it, and therefore I yearned to leave it. 

I tore through issue after issue of The Spectator and The Guardian, convinced that my real home was somewhere in the rolling hills of Umbria and that I had been planted in Kerala by colossal misadventure. It was only natural that I begin to dream of leaving.

Where would I go? I was not quite sure, but at fifteen years old, I was convinced of the necessity of leaving. I was not choosy: I did not particularly care whether I went to Europe, or America, or even Singapore-- so long as I left. 

"Why are you taking French?" demanded a classmate when we were both in the ninth standard. "It's not as though you'll ever go to France." 

I was astounded by the force of her conviction. It was only matched by the force of my own belief that I was destined to leave Trivandrum. Why was my classmate so dubious about my chances? After all, what was stopping either of us from leaving? All we needed were sufficient funds and a visa -- surely both of these were attainable once we reached adulthood. 

What I wanted, I thought, was a real city. I wanted to leave, to live in the kind of place where grown-up, unsavory things occurred. (I was, I think, still too young to comprehend the fact that life is unsavory everywhere.)

So it was, at the age of seventeen, that I found myself clutching a boarding pass for Boston, Massachusetts. I was tremendously excited- excited to be going to what I childishly thought of as 'The New World.' But I was even more excited to be leaving a place that I thought had little to do with me.

The memories of those first few days in New England are sharp and bright as the first snow. There was no detail of America so ordinary that it did not enthrall me: the vastness of the meals in our college cafeteria; the particular gold of the trees circling our dorms; the clipped accents of the girls in my World Civ. class. Each day was marked by fresh discovery: I can still remember with wonder how excited I was to wake up each morning.

"Do you miss home food?" asked a friend. I cannot remember what I told her, but I was quite certain that I did not. Although I had been a longtime devotee of spicy food, I was perfectly happy to enliven American food (which always consisted of too much cheese) with tabasco sauce. I would cast aside the memory of more pungent meals: I would not be drawn back into any kind of longing for a place I had plotted to escape. 

One of my first projects in that period was to decorate my dorm room, which was as bare as a cell. Full of anticipation, I trotted off to the local Walmart to purchase rugs, lamps, and all manner of things that I had seen in Good Housekeeping and other slick American magazines.

After a half-hour of browsing the shelves (so many! So varied!), I decided to buy a large roll of cerulean wallpaper with daisies on it. But when I set it down on the payment counter, the cashier stared. 

"You can't just take that," he said bluntly. "You need to -- that's not how you do it here-"

   He took a moment to gather himself before explaining that I needed to have it measured; that I should have had it measured before trying to pay for it. He did not speak unkindly, but it was clear that he was impatient. He had -- correctly enough -- pegged me as a foreigner; a person who was unfamiliar with American etiquette and who was therefore capable of wasting his time.\
It was the first intimation I had that this country I had embraced so wholly did not return the sentiment.

The first books Jhumpa Lahiri ever published-- Interpreter of Maladies and The Namesake -- are both concerned, in their own way, with Massachusetts. Her characters move from West Bengal to Boston and back again: it is in Boston that they experience the most malaise. They encounter chilly Americans and try to re-create the bhelpuri of home. They walk along the Charles River in saris under cardigans. They try to adapt, but they are all of them time-travelers: they never seem wholly present in the America they labored so hard to reach.

At first, I read these stories with apathy. I admired Lahiri's felicity in the language: she wrote both simply and flawlessly. I was pleased that an Indian-American writer had gained such renown. But I was somewhat bored by the fact that she seemed to have no other subject. Diasporic melancholy was not, to my mind, as vital a struggle as any of the others -- lust, greed, ambition- that we have as humans in this decaying universe. 

If you really didn't like it, I rationalized, you could always go home again.

In the innocence of those pre-Trump years, I did not imagine that the echo of those words would come back to haunt me. A faint, mocking refrain.

Leaving is simple enough; what is perhaps more difficult is to stay gone. 

In those first few years in America, I fell into the habit of spending a lot of my time at bus stations. For some mysterious reason, I came to believe that buses were the easiest way to disappear. I could take the next bus to a hundred miles away -- any bus -- and disappear into the cracks like a teenage runaway; a juvenile delinquent fleeing their parole officer; a man ghosting the woman who loves him in the most brutal fashion.

I thought then -- as I still sometimes do- that leaving was the bravest thing a person could do for themselves. To move was a shocking act: it was a leap into a great emptiness that we could not fathom. We did not know what was ahead but at least we weren't staying still. We were waging war on inertia. We were seeking out new ways to be happy, and we would pay the price of giving up community, family, the friends we had known so long in our homelands. 

I used to watch the buses pull out of the terminal for a long time. I wondered if any runaways were on them.

Here is a fact for you: before swallows migrate each year -- covering a distance of up to six thousand miles from England to Africa -- they put a little weight on, in preparation for the journey. One of the most astonishing things about this phenomenon is that they seem to know just how much to put on: their fat-reserves are typically only enough to last them the flight across the sea. 

There is, I have always maintained, a striking similarity between human beings and swallows in this regard- our glittering, audacious hope. We leave with so little; make do with a few pounds of extra weight. We have only the two (usually two) suitcases that are our baggage allowance for international flights. 

In these suitcases, we make room for necessities. Oversized coats; the fluffiest pair of boots we can wrangle. A jar of pickle or of a spice mix we won't easily find elsewhere. 

A passport. 

A rope around our shabby suitcase that will distinguish it from its plumper, glossier cousins on the carousel in Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle, J.F.K. 

We all of us know how to pack fast. We brag about it years after the fact -- I can pack my life up in two minutes -- as if it were not a little sad. Not even in the least.

I returned to Kerala in the summer of 2015, when I had least expected to. I was heartsick and weary. Ten years of living abroad had not been easy on me. 

It had not, after all, been so easy to go away and to stay gone. I had thought that I could claim America for myself, that all that kept me from belonging was my own lack of will-power. I had known nothing of the daily undignified struggles, of the bureaucracy of citizenship. I had not been prepared for the loneliness that seeped into my bones that last winter, or the knowledge that no place in the world was meant for me any more than my own home. Day after day, the sun set at three PM- and I watched the darkness with aching eyes. (But wasn't that a price I had agreed to pay? If you left, you left alone.) 

To my astonishment, Trivandrum was just as it had been when I left -- lush, hot, with only sleepy uncles and grass-snakes to bear witness to the passage of time. I looked out of the window of my tiny cab and marveled at how unchanged it seemed. Unlike every other town in India, it seemed as if nothing had progressed: as if nothing new or modern had entered Kerala in the last ten years.

   I wish I could say that it felt like home, but it didn't -- only a place I had left long ago and to which I would keep returning in my restless heart.
