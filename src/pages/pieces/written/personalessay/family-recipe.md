Step 1: Wait for the right time. Every year, the darkening nights indicate the coming of fall. Red leaves with burnt edges scuttle underneath the shiny, new plastic boots of young children going to school for the first time. The smell of warmth and bakery-fresh goods wafts out of nearby stores and hangs in the air, singing to several passersby. These changes at first seemed unfamiliar to me and my family, immigrants in a new country, but soon they became commonplace. It was autumn in America. 

Step 2: Do some research. In the midst of the reddening apples and the omnipotent pumpkins, I would hear about the festival of giving thanks. In school, we would learn about the origins of the holiday, rooted in the origins of America itself: after the Pilgrims arrived in the New World, only the help of the local Wampanoags afforded them the successful harvest necessary for survival. By legend, the Pilgrims held a festival, a grand dinner, with the Native American tribe to celebrate the coming together of old and new Americans to produce flourishing crops. It was indeed a myth, out of line with reality, but one that represented the idealist vision which Americans strove to attain. One that stressed equality, liberty, and prosperity to be shared by all. 

Step 3: Plan ahead. For years, I listened as my friends recounted tales of inviting eccentric aunts and boisterous cousins for a meal unparalleled by any other. Though I asked every year, my family never celebrated the holiday- my father, a doctor, always took the Thanksgiving shift to make up for the lack of staff that day. The festival was not ingrained in our culture either for us to feel deprived by not celebrating it, so each year we let it slip by us into the engulfing November winds. Finally, when I was fourteen, my father secured a day off on Thanksgiving, and we decided to hold a dinner like that of the fabled Pilgrims and the Wampanoags four hundred years before. 

Step 4: Gather your ingredients. Ingredients List: 

- Turkey - Kosher salt - Ground pepper - Vegetable oil - Herbs and spices: rosemary, sage, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder That week, I bobbled alongside my mother as we scoured the aisles of our local grocery store. We searched through rows and rows of neatly pressed packages for the unfamiliar European spices on our list, rosemary and thyme and sage and garlic powder. Ecstatic over this grocery store haul, I became a child once again, picking nearly everything off the shelves, and, with full arms, dumping the entire grocery store into our trolley. Gleefully I tossed potatoes and turkey stuffing and apple cider into the cart. 

Step 5: Find the right turkey. My mouth opened in awe as I saw the rows and rows of packaged and refrigerated turkeys; the birds were lined up wing to wing, just waiting to be picked up. They were pressed up tightly against the taut plastic covering displaying pictures of fully-prepared Thanksgiving turkeys, as if to show the bird inside what it could become. Since there were only four of us to feed (the rest of my family lives abroad), I picked up the smallest turkey there, which was just about the size of my head. 

Step 6: Give back. We bought two turkeys that day: one for ourselves, and one to give to the local senior center. My mother insisted that if we were to embrace the culinary aspect of the festival, we should embrace every aspect, including a display of thanks to our community. My mother, my sister, and I drove to the senior center and volunteered the night before Thanksgiving. Though it was humid and cramped in the kitchen that day, there was something about it I enjoyed. All the people in the room, even those whose families were not with them, looked content. The hostess of that night's festivities concluded the dinner by asking everybody in the room where they were born. Only a handful of the hundred in the room, we found, were born within this country. The rest were immigrants- Bolivians, Colombians, Poles, Germans, Italians, Russians, Koreans, Indians, Chinese, Vietnamese. These diverse people were all sitting at the same tables, under the same roof, with the same Thanksgiving meal in front of them. They were all Americans. 

Step 7: On Thanksgiving Day, preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. On Thanksgiving morning, there was a buzz in the air. Outside, the fallen leaves had coated the grass in a velvet layer of golden-red. A cold breath had frosted over the glass of car windows in a sugar glaze. Inside, it was warm and crisp and the perfect mood for cooking. 

Step 8: Sprinkle the cavity of the turkey with salt & pepper, then stuff. I squirmed and giggled as my sister reached into the insides of the turkey, my laughter bubbling more and more with every grimace of discomfort that appeared on her face. The stuffing was persistent on spilling out of the cavity, and my sister angrily threatened the dead bird while pushing the mix of aromatic herbs and spices back in. 

Step 9: Brush the turkey with oil, then season with herbs and spices. 

- American herbs and spices: rosemary, sage, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder - Indian herbs and spices: tandoori masala, cloves, cinnamon, elaichi (cardamom), dhania 

(coriander), ginger-garlic paste, cashew paste, curd, lemon Looking at the assortment of American seasonings and herbs in front of us, my parents voiced the concern that the turkey might not taste good to us; after all, we had all developed Indian taste buds, and Western-style meat was often too bland. In the end, we reached a compromise: we furnished the left half of the turkey with the American herbs we bought and the right half with the Indian spices we already owned and had become accustomed to. On the raw turkey, the difference was stark- the left side looked a pale brown with sprinkled pale-yellows and greens; the right side was a 

deep brownish-red. 

Step 10: Put the turkey in the oven, roast for 2-3 hours. After the turkey was fully prepared, we put it in the oven and let it roast. I watched as the turkey tanned and the spices deepened in color and blended together. Once the turkey began crisping a shade of caramel-brown, we deemed it ready. The finished product was two-toned, golden and deep burgundy, not unlike the autumn leaves outside which were blowing steadily through the streets and far away from the trees from which they had grown. Where red met gold blossomed the greatest combination of spices- green rosemary swirled into seeds of dhania, sprinked thyme danced alongside roasted elachi, and sweet-smelling sage mixed thoroughly into rich tandoori masala. 

Step 11: Set the table & serve. We laid the finished product on top of the burnt-orange tablecloth, along with an assortment of colorful Indian and American side dishes. A bowl of paneer tikka masala sat beside a platter of biscuits, and a plate of Indian-style fried rice shared a space with a dish of mashed potatoes. For the first time, we not only ate with one another, but listened to one another and were truly grateful for one another. Finally we understood what the festival was about. For that one day, we believed in the Thanksgiving myth we knew was not true and gave thanks for the culture we had in our lives.
