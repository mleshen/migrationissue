Once, when a friend told me my childhood home looked like it was "decorated by immigrants", I found myself counting the family photos my parents had hung haphazardly on our walls. 

Every year around December, on a Sunday morning, the three of us would dress up in garish, itchy Indian clothing that we had tried our best to color-coordinate and drive across town to the JCPenney Portrait Studio. The sun was just beginning to rise, and we tried to blink away the sleep that crept into the pinks of our eyes. It was the one day a year my mother wore bright scarlet lipstick, and my father, a tie; the only day I would watch my father awkwardly embrace my mother's waist from behind at the behest of that year's portrait studio photographer -- always a bubbly, bespectacled white woman eager to finish off our photo package with a few, complimentary "couples shots" that would somehow end up in the bottom drawer of my mother's dresser.

The portraits -- frozen memorials of moments when I had braces stapled to my teeth, and my father, a full head of hair -- were visibly crooked hanging on our walls, but we were too lazy to straighten them, or perhaps we had become so accustomed to their slant that it felt natural, and we had forgotten. The photo frames -- each of a different, woody hue -- leaned outward from the walls like devotees at prayer, threatening to dislodge from the nails that affixed them, shatter to the floor in resignation.

I also began to notice the trinkets we had scattered along the mantelpiece: sundry souvenirs from our family travels, some attempt at piecing together the world we had collectively journeyed. Here, in our recreated model, Australia sat next to Belgium, Yellowstone behind Hawaii: a miniature stuffed koala stood, undisturbed by the presence of an adjacent Pissing Boy figurine; a ceramic grizzly bear looked over the shoulder of a tiki shot glass. All of this was dwarfed in the foreground by a huge, mandala tapestry hanging behind the mantelpiece that my parents had brought with them when they left India two decades ago.

Among our hodgepodge of mantelpiece souvenirs were my snowglobes, which had evolved from a collector's pastime into a kind of fixation in which my parents and I allowed ourselves to repeatedly indulge, refusing to conclude any family vacation without ensuring that one had been secured for me from a roadside souvenir shop and tucked between the soft folds of clothing in my suitcase, even if it was small, and cheap, and ugly. ("So you will remember this place," my mother would tell me every time we bought one for my growing stockpile.)

And there was the art that festooned our walls -- mismatched pieces salvaged from museum gift shops around the world. Our dining room was an unlikely meeting place for Ansel Adams and Salvador Dalí; our living room, a belated homage to the March on Washington, memorialized in a poster my father had purchased at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Historical Site in Atlanta, in a moment of awe of the Reverend's struggle. ("He was a great man," my father said matter-of-factly to the gift shop cashier.)

On college move-in day, I found myself folding up the piece of twine that I had packed to clip and string photos across my dorm room wall. I tucked the pictures of friends and family I had brought with me back into their original envelope and tossed it into my desk drawer. I discarded the frayed Red Hot Chili Peppers poster that had hung above my bed at home for years, and sold the bulletin board I had ordered for my new room to a girl down the hall.

I desired a simple, American sophistication for my dorm room that my friend had reminded me was missing from my childhood home in Arizona, and I was determined to achieve it by renouncing tacky photos and cheap souvenirs. That day, my parents kept asking me if I was sure I wanted to leave my dorm room walls bare, and I ignored their questions out of a fear that I'd change my own mind.

It was not until nighttime, after I had dropped them off at the airport and we had exchanged goodbyes, that I began to understand my parents and the world they had created.

Under the waning summer moon's glow, my dorm room walls were naked and white, and the room felt like an icebox, though I had shut off the air conditioner and buried my bare skin beneath fleece sweaters and fuzzy socks. It was only September, yet a Boston summer was but an Arizona winter, and I had come prepared.

That night, I fell asleep shivering, and woke up thinking I was back at home. But the barren walls to which I opened my eyes the next morning served as an unflinching reminder that this room, for all its simplicity, was no home. Boston was a foreign land, and, I, an immigrant -- but here, in my newcomer's solitude, I had nothing to remind me of my past journeys, to tell me I could do it all over again.
