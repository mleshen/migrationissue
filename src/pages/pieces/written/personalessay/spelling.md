There is a recipe for winning a spelling bee. 

First, repeat the word out loud once it is said to you, slowly. Smear your tongue around its edges. Taste it. Pause. Swallow fat gulps of air. Let them gently tickle the roof of your mouth. Hold each one, suspended in your lungs. Wait. Then, release.

Next, ask for the word's definition -- even if you are certain you already know what the word means. Ask for the word to be used in a sentence. Then, for the language of origin. Alternate pronunciations. Homophones.

When you are ready to spell, say the word once again, nice and slow. Then, pry it apart gently, like lint from a wool sweater. Let the letters dribble off your tongue, each drawn out and evenly spaced. Do not stumble, or let the wrong letters roll off, for you will be disqualified. Instead, free each letter from your grasp gently, like you are releasing fledglings from a cage. Pronounce the letters crisply. Round your o's. Iron out your e's. Pucker your u's.

When you are finished spelling, say the word one final time. Then, wait. Pray you do not hear the blood-curdling chime of a silver call bell in the distance.

My parents and around 300 other people have driven out to the Arizona State School for the Deaf and Blind on a Saturday morning in February to spectate the 2009 Pima County Spelling Bee. It is held in a stuffy auditorium teeming with strident yellow stage lights. Foldable gray metal chairs have been combed into neat rows onstage. A lectern for the pronouncer stands diagonally from the chairs. Next to it, a slender microphone for contestants. A plastic folding table has been set up on the opposite end of the stage, where three judges will sit and make notes during each round.

The spelling bee begins at 9 o'clock in the morning with a practice round for all the contestants, comprised of around 50 children including me who range from the third grade to the eighth grade and had each won their respective schools' spelling bees. The practice round is meant to be a warm-up, in which the pronouncer is to deliver simple, three- or four-letter words to each contestant. Its sole purpose is to help the contestants grow comfortable maneuvering the stage and practice speaking into the microphone before the real contest begins.

When the pronouncer tells me my practice word is "tall," I am confident. So assured I know how to spell the word, in fact, that I deviate from the recipe for winning a spelling bee I had painstakingly concocted and decide to jump right into spelling.

"Tall," I repeat with a smile. I search for my parents among a cluster of blurred faces in the audience, each distorted and stripped of nuance by the glare of the stage lights, and make eye contact with them before beginning to spell the word. It is a familiar word, one I'd heard them say many times on road trips and family vacations. When I spot them, my mother grins. My father gives me a thumbs-up and winks.

"T-o-l-l. Tall."

*Ding*.

My heart slams into my chest. I hear the faint echo of chuckles resound among the audience members.

*Thank God it was only a practice round*, I try to remind myself under the soft hiss I feel bubbling in my ears with a quickening speed.

"It's probably because she's so short," an elderly white woman in the audience whispers to her husband in the moment of my error, blissfully unaware that my parents are sitting in the row behind them. Later, my mother would relay the old woman's joke to me with a tone that sat squarely between amusement and disappointment.

After overcoming my shock at misspelling "tall", my next reaction is of sheer confusion. My parents had always pronounced "toll" with an open-mid back rounded vowel, the same vowel that was pronounced in "tall". To them, "toll" and "tall" were homophones, the same way that, to them, "bowl" and "bowel" sounded the same, "drawer" and "draw" were identical.

When I misspell the word onstage, I trudge back to my seat in the back row and slink low on its cool, metal surface. The cold veneer of the chair introduces a new discomfort that partially distances my mind from the shame I have just engendered on behalf of myself and my parents, who have invited three other Indian families to watch the competition alongside them. Two of the families have children who are just a few years younger than me and will participate in the spelling bee next year. I know, without being told, that I was supposed to set an example. 

That year, I finish in the top six contestants of the Pima County Spelling Bee. By the penultimate round, I am one of the youngest spellers -- a fourth-grader who remains among five eighth-graders -- to ever make it this far in the competition. By the time there are just six of us remaining onstage, almost no one in the audience remembers I had misspelled the word given to me in the practice round.

But when the bee concludes in the early afternoon, it is the first thing on my mind when I reunite with my parents in the auditorium lobby. There, I forgo the customary kiss on the cheek they each give me whenever I have made them proud. Instead, I am quick to tell them that it was their Indian accents -- which I had always secretly thought were knotty and grating -- that caused me to misspell the word "tall."

The first time I became conscious of the racial dynamics of spelling bees was the summer before the Pima County Spelling Bee: in 2008. I had just finished the third grade and, in celebration of the beginning of another sweltering, Arizona summer, had retired to my family's living room sofa to watch the 81st Scripps National Spelling Bee on television.

I had watched televised spelling bees before -- *Akeelah and the Bee*, an episode of Charlie Brown -- but had never understood the quiet and insidious way race shaped them until that summer, the same way I had watched the Steelers beat the Seahawks during Super Bowl XL two years prior but had not begun to understand the racial politics of football until 2016, when I learned of Colin Kaepernick. In the years before that, all I knew was that football was all-American, a big deal, and I was to enjoy it, even if I didn't completely understand it.

Spelling bees, I learned, were to be treated the same way -- until brown kids began to win them.

Since 1985, there have been 27 Indian American winners of the Scripps National Spelling Bee; 60 percent of winners in the last 35 years have been of Indian descent. But 2008 wasn't the first time it happened: it was simply the beginning of a 12-year consecutive streak that, as of 2019, has yet to be broken. It was the year Sameer Mishra won the national competition. I remember gripping the thick leather arms of the sofa with flushed fingernails that summer as my mother and I watched Mishra follow the recipe all spellers had committed to memory: *Say the word once. Spell it slowly. Say the word again.*

"Guerdon," Mishra said, "G-u-e-r-d-o-n. Guerdon."

Moments later, wisps of rainbow confetti snowed onto the stage. Mishra had won, and his victory would be the first of a 12-year streak of consecutive victories among Indian American spellers. It would also usher in an era of questioning the winners' place in America. On social media, I'd read angry Twitter users' lamentations of "foreigners" winning the bee, telling them to "go back" to India and calling them terrorists. I'd seethe at online comments, made in jest, discussing the contestants' "robotic" demeanors, alleging that these children were fated to the rote office lives of doctors and engineers, pointing out similarities between the convoluted words these children spelled and their own, lengthy last names -- which, like my own, often sounded impossibly tortuous to white ears. I'd let Internet gifs and memes comparing these kids to Apu from *The Simpsons* and depicting their emotionless visages collectively boil a hot, sputtering soup of anger inside me with which I didn't know what to do.

After the competition that year, an Associated Press reporter interviewed Mishra and asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up.

"I want to be a neurosurgeon," he told the reporter plainly. "You know, perform surgeries on the brain. I think that would be pretty cool."

At eight years old, I found solace in his comment. At the time, I, too, was convinced I'd become a doctor. I came from a pedigree of physicians, and following in their footsteps was something I'd never seriously questioned until my final two years of high school. From Kindergarten through tenth grade, whenever I was asked by a teacher or classmate or made to write my life's ambitions down on an annual student career day poster, I'd toss out a different "dream job" in the medical field. One day I wanted to become a radiologist; the next, a psychiatrist; the day after that, a cardiothoracic surgeon.

Fittingly, my parents had always placed a high priority on my academic life, encouraging me to do well in school and make the most of intellectual opportunities that came my way, the spelling bee included. In 2009, when my parents heard my elementary school was to host a spelling bee, they encouraged me to sign up as a fourth-grader: after all, a spelling bee would be a prime opportunity to improve my reading and writing skills in preparation for a future in the medical field.

It took years for me to realize the impact that spelling bees also had on my sense of self, identity, and belonging in American society.

Years after the 2009 Pima County Spelling Bee, when I began high school, I signed up for an anatomy class and joined a club for students interested in the health profession. Through the club, I discovered a competitive activity that combined two of my strengths: anatomy and spelling. Dubbed "medical spelling," the competition was held every year at the club's state conference, through which I would compete against students from across Arizona who were members of their high schools' respective club chapters. If I won the state conference, I would move on to nationals.

The medical spelling bee was like any other spelling bee -- but consisted exclusively of medical words, often derived from Latin roots. The recipe for winning was no different in this bee than in any of the others in which I'd participated. Say the word once. Spell it slowly. Say the word again.

When I won the state competition in the spring of 2015, my mother -- a pediatrician -- helped me study hundreds of medical roots, prefixes, and suffixes in preparation for the national competition, which was to be held in the early summer. She quizzed me using flashcards I had cut squarely from jumbo, college-ruled index cards. -*Algia*. Pain. -*Pnea*. Breath. *Somno*-. Sleep. We drilled the words and their spellings for months, conjuring up mnemonics while sitting at the dining table every evening after school. My mother would keep an eye on the pot of sambaar  bubbling on the stove while quizzing me on words she found thumbing through a dusty medical dictionary she'd salvaged from her medical school days and stored at the bottom of our living room bookshelf.

My mother and I traveled to California for the national competition that year, held in an upscale hotel's conference center in Anaheim. On the day of the medical spelling bee, we discovered that parents of contestants weren't allowed inside the seminar room where the competition was to be held, so my mother waited outside in the hallway for three hours, sitting with her legs outstretched on the coarse carpeted floor and her laptop perched on her knees, pretending to catch up on office work, though we both knew she was too nervous to concentrate.

At nationals, I made the top six contestants, again. 

"Ancylostomatidae. *Ann-kill-oh-sto-mat-id-ee*," the pronouncer -- a middle-aged white woman -- said, rounding out each sound perfectly, and I knew it was over for me when I heard the final syllable, which I had no idea how to spell.

Ding.

That night, after I told my mother of my medical spelling bee loss, she took me to the Cheesecake Factory near our hotel. We normally wouldn't have eaten out on a night like this, but we had no choice -- we were staying in a hotel and couldn't cook, so we were forced to spend money at a restaurant, although neither of us were in any mood to celebrate. Sitting in a cushy, two-person booth with globes of hushed orange lighting hanging from the ceiling, our conversation was a solemn contrast to the electropop music blaring from the speakers, the sounds of glasses clinking and stilettos chattering in the adjacent bar area.

We tried not to talk about the spelling bee that night, reaching far into the depths of our minds for some other topic to discuss. Any other topic.

But I could not stop myself. As soon as the waiter placed our warm bowls of pasta on the table and turned his back, I blamed my mother for my loss. I criticized her for pronouncing the Latin "-ae" suffix with a long a vowel sound instead of a long e vowel. We had drilled -ae words before, but had always said ay instead of ee. Scapul-ay. Larv-ay. Antenn-ay. I wasn't prepared for the other, "correct" pronunciation when I heard it at the competition, and I made that clear to my mother during our dinner conversation, pointing my finger accusingly in her direction and sniffling back hot, sour tears every time the waiter approached to check on us. 

My sniffles were so loud and my vision was so blurred by the tears I had arrested at the base of my eyelids, which now pooled near my tear ducts, that I did not realize until later that in that moment, my mother had begun to cry, too. 

In my heart, I knew that misspelling the word was my fault, but at the time, it seemed easier to blame my mother's foreignness -- the stridency of her Indian accent scraping the walls of my memory -- for my failure than to accept it as my own, to gather up the shards of responsibility with my two hands and try to piece my relationship with my mother back together again.

There's an old joke that equates my spelling bee success with my last name: a 14-letter, six-syllable, phonetic jumble of letters, that, when sewn together, often become painful for white ears to hear and embarrassing for white tongues to attempt to pronounce. The joke, often told to me by a white person, is always something along the lines of, "Your last name is so long. No wonder you're so good at spelling long words!"

Long last names are common in my South Indian, Tamil, Hindu extended family, in which last names range from four or five letters to fifteen or seventeen. My last name is actually my father's given name, and in line with a generational tradition of passing along a father's first name to his children as their last name, "Venkataramanan" was bestowed upon me at birth. Growing up as an only child, I often looked to other Indian American children in my family and hometown community -- in particular, those who had long last names themselves -- to validate my own, convoluted last name. I most often found this sense of validation during biennial summer trips to India.

Throughout my elementary school years, I'd look forward to visiting family in India every other summer. At the time, I identified as being "from India" -- though I wasn't born there and had never lived there for more than a month at a time on vacation -- and referred to these summer vacation trips as going "back home." The 24-hour journeys were long and arduous. My parents and I would fly, with five large suitcases in tow, from our hometown of Tucson, Arizona to a major American airport -- often Los Angeles or Chicago, where we'd endure long layovers, munching on airport food court dinners from McDonald's and Popeye's before boarding a 10-hour plane to a major European layover city: London, Frankfurt, or Brussels -- or a Middle Eastern layover city: Doha, Dubai, or Abu Dhabi. From those midpoints, we'd take another, 10-hour flight to Chennai or Hyderabad, depending on whether we were visiting my mother's family or father's family first.

Sometimes, we'd journey in the reverse direction, flying over the Pacific from Tucson to Los Angeles, Los Angeles to Kuala Lumpur (or Hong Kong, or Taipei), and from one of these East Asian cities to Chennai. These journeys were even more grueling. Uninterrupted by a midpoint layover, the plane rides from the United States to East Asia were up to 18 hours long, followed by a four- or five-hour plane ride from East Asia to India.

During those summers, I'd spend three to five weeks in India, typically from the months of June to July. The weeks were filled with taking beach and temple trips with my family, attending relatives' weddings (which were commonly held in June and July, in line with the Hindu calendar that deemed these months as auspicious for marriage), devouring old Enid Blyton books in my grandfather's house (or buying pirated copies of American bestseller fiction from streetside bazaars), and convincing my cousins in Chennai, Pune, and Coimbatore that I was one of them, despite the American English that naturally dripped from my tongue and the clumsy, slow, foreign-sounding Tamil that would earn laughter and scorn from my relatives.

"I am just as Indian as you all are," I'd retort defiantly when my cousins refused to play games like pallanguli, antakshari, and carrom with me because I was too "Americanized". They'd mock my American accent and the many white friends I had accumulated as a child, flipping through the pages of the elementary school yearbook I had packed in my suitcase to show them and stopping to point, with their middle fingers, at different photos they found most striking.

"I'm Meena and I'm from Yoo-Ess. All my friends are Americans named Sarah, Hannah, and Zoe and have blonde hair," my cousins would tease, supplanting "the U.S.A.," "the U.S.," or simply "America" with a tightened, Indian-sounding "Yoo-Ess" and loosening their pronunciation of "all my friends" in an attempt to imitate an American accent perfectly, but inevitably sounding awkward and unskilled in their efforts. I noticed that they also freely used the term "Americans" to describe my white friends, but never used the term in reference to me. To them, I was merely an N.R.I.: a non-resident Indian, or worse, an A.B.C.D.: an American-born confused Desi. But I found some solace in the fact that my cousins and I looked the same despite our cultural differences: I was a Venkataramanan with medium-brown-colored skin and jet-black hair. My cousins were Venkateswarans, Sundararajans, and Chandrasekhars with similar facial and physical features. Even if they ostracized me for being different, I thought, I could still take pride in the fact that we looked similar. Maybe it would help me feel less alone.

After I began competing in spelling bees, starting with the 2009 spelling bee, I'd use my biennial summer trips to India as prime opportunities to study for each competition. I'd save PDFs and Excel spreadsheets with thousands of words on my laptop, coupled with the physical Merriam-Webster and Oxford dictionaries I'd tucked deep into the folds of my backpack, and would spend the long plane rides harnessing the light from my laptop screen to illuminate the paper dictionary entries I thumbed through when I couldn't fall asleep.

My grandparents' houses lacked an Internet connection and centralized air conditioner, so every afternoon, as my parents and relatives took afternoon naps, I'd sit by an oversized air conditioning machine jammed between two rusty windows in the drawing room relying on the offline files I had already downloaded to make paper flashcards out of multicolored cardstock. If I desperately needed to use the Internet during those five weeks, my mom and I would walk down the street to a local Internet café, where we'd pay a small sum of rupees that would grant me one to two hours of Internet access on a gargantuan, three-dimensional, off-white desktop computer, and extra rupees to print any class assignments or spelling word lists required for my studies. My cousins in India would often be in the midst of studying for their own exams: the state and national exams they were required to take each year to determine their class ranking; the undergraduate, pre-professional, or vocational school tests needed for admission to their top-choice universities; or the medical school entrance or licensing exams that would determine their earning potential and job security for the rest of their lives. Growing up, a few of them would express to me their ultimate desire to move to the United States for college or graduate school. To this day, a handful have successfully immigrated to America. The others remain in India.

Over the course of our relationships, I have learned that some of my cousins have changed or contracted their last names to "Venkat," "Venkata," "Chandra," "Sekhar," or "Rajan" upon immigrating to the United States. Others have "Americanized" the spellings of their names or converted them into spellings and themes that are familiar and easy for white eyes to process: "Sunder," "Shaker," "Raj."

I have chosen to retain my last name in its original form, though it has always been a dead giveaway to white Americans that I am not, and will never be, one of them.

I often make cold phone calls to stores and companies: to order takeout from restaurants, to check store closing times, to cancel flight reservations. On the calls, I pass for white. I speak the standard "American English" dialect -- largely commanded by white America -- that linguists have held in high esteem for centuries. At home, my dialect is mostly similar, with the exception of my minor code-switches into Indian English: I tell my parents that I am about to "go for bath," as opposed to informing them that I will soon take a shower.

My code-switches are subconscious, and I do not often tell others about how I speak to my parents at home. I worry that my peers will paint me as disingenuous and accuse me of feeling the need to earn belonging and acceptance in American society by speaking in white American English in public and Indian English at home. My father often points it out, especially when I slip into American idioms during at-home, casual conversations.

"Cats and dogs," he teases me regularly. "Rainbows and unicorns. Break a leg. Stop talking like you're white."

Yet, combing through my desk drawers as a college student, I continue to unearth evidence that I have tried tirelessly to be white for years: the spelling word flashcards cut from cardstock, the stacks of Oxford English and Merriam-Webster dictionaries, the International Phonetic Alphabet pronunciation guides instructing me on how to pronounce American English words that have constantly made me feel small upon hearing my parents and relatives speak them aloud, because I know that their pronunciations are wrong. I have been taught that the ones in my IPA pronunciation guides are the correct ones.

Two years after the medical spelling bee, when I arrived at Harvard in August 2017, I searched for the kids who used to do spelling bees. I quickly narrowed my survey to the Indian American community on campus, where I was confident I'd find at least a couple of students who knew the recipe to winning spelling bees I'd learned by heart, who'd spent various moments of their lives onstage, prying apart the beautiful, twisted taxonomies of words in the English language and stitching them back together again.

Within the first week, I'd found a match. I met her at a South Asian campus community brunch in early September. As we chewed on undercooked dosas that morning, tearing off their fluffy edges with our teeth and dipping them in tomato chutney, I felt a strange sense of familiarity, like I'd seen her somewhere before.

She had made it to the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 2013, placing in the top six contestants, I learned from the third search hit when I Googled her name later that evening, curious as to where I had seen her before. I was amazed. So, weeks later, when I ran into her again, I tried to broach the subject, casually mentioning that she looked somewhat familiar when I first met her, and if she ever did spelling bees growing up.

She shut me down with a staggering force.

"Stop," she commanded, even a hint of a playful smile absent from her expression. Her cheeks grew a deep red. "I don't want to talk about that. Never bring it up again."

I didn't. 

*

The last spelling bee in which I ever competed occurred just one month later, in October of my freshman year at Harvard. It was the freshman intramural spelling bee, and was held in an ashy lecture hall in Harvard Yard during First-Year Family Weekend. My parents couldn't fly across the country from Arizona to see me on campus that weekend, so I spent the two-day period bashfully accepting lunch and dinner invitations from my friends' parents and acclimating to the onset of my first New England autumn, whose three-dimensional beauty surpassed what I'd only seen flattened into Harvard brochures in the lobby of my high school's college counseling center.

I tied for first place in the spelling bee that day, besting around 30 other freshmen, many of whom brought their parents to the event to watch. After the competition was over, I was asked to pose for a photo with my co-winner, a slender black man; the pronouncer, a Harvard biology professor; and the judge, Harvard's Dean of Freshmen. 

"Congratulations," the dean, an elderly white man with a yellowish grin, said to us as he wrapped each of his arms around our shoulders.

Then he turned to me alone, and said, "You've done spelling bees before, haven't you?"

"Yes!" I exclaimed and grinned for the camera, not thinking twice in that moment.

But for days after, I couldn't stop ruminating on his question. How did he know I'd done spelling bees before? And why did he ask me, and not my co-winner? Was it because he perceived my spelling technique -- meticulous and packaged in a way my co-winner's was not? Or was it because -- and I hated to think it -- I was Indian? Or worse -- because my co-winner was black, and the dean did not expect him to win?

I never ran into my co-winner again that year, and soon, the features of his face began to lose their sharp details in my mind. And the next time I saw the Dean of Freshmen, he did not remember who I was; to him, the intramural spelling bee was just another activity on his endless list of engagements. But I carried the incisive weight of his question on the thick of my shoulders for the rest of the year, wondering what he could have meant.

Indians and spelling bees, when combined, have become something of a caricature in American culture. The Scripps National Spelling Bee's victors have been lionized as folk heroes in Indian communities across the world -- celebrated in Whatsapp groups and news articles by Indian media -- yet allegorized as Internet memes everywhere else.

And it is becoming increasingly apparent that there are two sides to the racial dynamics of American spelling bees: both the external racialization of Indian American winners and participants -- that is, the general, public expectation of their spelling bee success -- and the simultaneous marginalization many of these spellers have internalized all their lives while painstakingly preparing for such competitions.

Sometimes, I wonder why my Indian American classmate at Harvard was so reluctant to reminisce about her spelling bee days when I asked her about them at that community brunch. Was it because she knew that, as a person of Indian descent, spelling bee success was naturally expected of her by the general American populace? Or was it because thinking of spelling bees still brings back personally painful memories: of forcefully and regularly shutting down her mother's stilted Indian pronunciations of English words over family dinners, of rejecting rigid Indian accents all her life in favor of chocolatey American ones, of being foolish enough to think that spending hours memorizing the written conventions of American English would be sufficient to secure a permanent sense of belonging in the United States, unadulterated by the inevitable racism of being a person of color? After all, to win a spelling bee as an Indian American is to conform to a long-held expectation set by others: one that aligns beautifully with the tropes of the Indian doctor, the straight-A student, the emotionless, academic robot.

I admit I often still feel that way, opting to tuck my spelling bee days into a hidden sweater pocket and pretend they never existed. Instead, today I prefer to show the white Americans around me the multitude of ways in which I have evolved to be a "different" kind of Indian American: evinced by my passion for literature and the humanities, my penchant for rap music, my deep sense of engagement with the very civic issues from which my ethnic community has historically shied away. But in burying my past, I wonder if I am more similar to my Indian American Harvard classmate -- and the other Indian American spelling bee alumni with whom I am acquainted -- than I had originally thought.

Ultimately, I believe there is something more to Indian Americans who spent their childhoods participating in spelling bees: something hidden under the triumphant smiles, the wispy confetti, the lustrous trophies. Something inexplicably tied to immigrant histories, to unanswerable questions of belonging, to the ineffable trauma of building an American identity upon an implicit rejection of the one in which you were raised. Something perceptible only among members of our ethnic community yet indescribable to those on the outside, whether we pick up on it within the folds of casual conversations or during the heated final moments of a spelling bee: the tense, proving ground of English language acquisition and American identity.

Sometimes, in moments of boredom, I search the names of former Indian American Scripps National Spelling Bee winners on the Internet, as if to assemble my own "where are they now?" series from the decorated fragments of their lives I am able to access through LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google. Some, I learn, are financial analysts on Wall Street; others, attorneys in Washington. A few are doctors.

I was never one of them. I never studied hard enough to attend the Scripps National Spelling Bee as a child, let alone emerge from it victorious. My spelling bee success was largely confined to local contests and the opening rounds of less-renowned national competitions, like the medical spelling bee. But to this day, whenever I meet other Indian American alumni of spelling bees -- at Harvard, or elsewhere -- I feel a shared sense of identity, of assimilation, of loss.

At this point, I have largely tucked my memories of spelling bees into a distant corner of my mind. On most days, I do not think of them. Other times, it takes just one, obscure association --- often submerged in the fluid contours of a passing thought --- to bring me back to my spelling bee days. Silver call bells. Stuffy auditoriums. Indian accents. Cheesecake Factories. The soft whimper of my mother's cry, muffled by my own.
