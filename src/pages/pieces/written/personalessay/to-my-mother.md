When I was 12 and saw you cry, I hid in my room until it was safe to come out. 

When I was 15 and saw you cry, I thought you deserved it and ignored you.

When I was 17 and saw you cry, I stayed in the room feeling so awkward.

When I was 20 and saw you cry, I'd sit next to you and wondered how long it would take this time.

When I was 23 and saw you cry, I'd pat your shoulder and sit next to you, thinking of what to say but not saying anything because nothing sounded right.

Now I'm 25 and when I see you cry, I sit next to you. Sometimes I lean on your shoulders, sometimes I hug you to me, sometimes I hold your hand, but mostly I tell you its ok, that they are men and that's how men are and for you to not be sad, to not think too much. 

Once, I cried with you, tears between mother and daughter, between woman and woman. It was unexpected, and I realized how much empathy hurts. I think of my brothers who have grown on the back of a woman who has always bended because she was taught to bend. I think of my father who is perhaps relieved in the belief that such a woman would never stand upright and walk away, and I think of my sister who at the age of eighteen has said she will never marry if this is what to be a married woman is. "Love is not worth it," she has said, conviction in her voice, a surrender in her breath.

I have fallen in love, Mother, and I am scared. 

So stand tall, mother, stand tall. I need you to stand tall and upright--if not for you, then for me. To have grown by your side, to have been raised on your back and your hands and your tears, I have witnessed this half of your life just as you have borne witness to the whole of mine. When I hear paternal grandma say that it is your fault if you cannot get your husband to do what you ask, when I hear maternal grandma say that you must be bear with it, that you must endure, us siab ntev, all I hear is that it's you, you, you, and the word compromise means that only you must be the one to give way. Our lives as women need not revolve around a man, feminism has shown me that, but the roots of patriarchy are deep and it takes communal strength to untangle those roots, to unlearn these wisdoms of generations that have been based upon sacrifice.

You have taught me many things, and I recognize them now as your love for me and your wish for me to live well and be happy--but these lessons you pass onto me are lessons of submission, lessons of endurance, lessons of self-sacrifice, such are the methods you have used in your own life and such are the methods that have been taught and given to you by others. We must submit, we must endure, we must sacrifice ourselves because our selves do not belong only to us. We start as a daughter, a sister, a woman who bears the surname of our fathers, and one day, we will be a wife, a daughter-in-law, a sister-in-law, a mother to children who will bear the surname of our husband. Each title is nuanced with connections and responsibilities. We are born from roots of legacies and will birth new ones. Submit, endure, sacrifice, for your life is never just your own. 

Under such weight, who can stand tall? 

I have fallen in love mother, and I am scared, scared because the man I love is not one I am supposed to love. He is older, he has a child from a marriage that was not a marriage, he is not Hmong. These roots I have grown from and these roots that have nourished me, will they allow me to love such a man whose roots I've been warned not to mix with? You have told me many times that marriage is never just about love, that even love is not about love. The heart must not guide us in these decisions because when we women let our hearts lead, it leads us towards men we should not love, men who will treat us the way they chew sugar cane, drain our sweetness in their tongues then spit us out when we are dry. We must love correctly.

Stand tall, Mother, stand tall. I need you to stand tall for me. Love is not worth it, my sister said. In response to a story I wrote about family, a male colleague commented that he found it unsettling how love is used as a means of control. I was shocked, and thought "When has love not been about control?" Who I can love, who I should love--the lessons you have taught me about men, the messages I have heard from movies, from books, from the mouths of other women and even from the mouths of men themselves, they all caution me against men. I must be careful, I must be cautious. I am woman and I can be tainted, I can be ruined, my life at the mercy of the emotions of the men I encounter. My next door neighbor, my classmate, my coworker--will these men honor and be kind, or will they use me? My father, my brothers, my grandfathers, my uncles--will these men uphold and protect me, or will they leave me, and in a community where the roots of patriarchy knots into everything, a strong woman will be forced to bend, to forever bend, because her life was made to never be her own. 

I have grown seeing you cry, mother. I have grown seeing you weep over things you cannot control, anguish over people who did not cherish you, and in your sorrow I sometimes wanted to shake your shoulders and tell you to let go, to sever yourself from attachments that bring you only heartache. I have once, and only once, told you to divorce your husband, to divorce father, to divorce yourself from this man who seems to be the direct and indirect source of your pain, and do you remember what you said to me? You told me no, you told me he is a good man. He doesn't beat you, he doesn't beat us. He doesn't fool around with other women. As much as you complain about him, you say he is still better, and then you say it is also for us, for your children. You do not want us to be fatherless, to be motherless, to be orphans without a home connected and protected by both mother and father, that for us you will stay. To love is to give control, to surrender control, and to hope that who you've given control to will cherish you.  

You have told me that I am your hope, that because of me you can be proud and my success is your success. I've wondered how to explain to you the dangers of living through someone and yet I have come to understand that perhaps this is your way to survive. You have told me in various words that I must be careful in choosing the man I will marry. Look not just at him, you've said. Look at his family. Does his father have multiple wives? Does his siblings drink? Is there a history of men beating their wives? I must tell you when I am interested in a man, you warn. I must tell you so that you can also ask around. A woman never just chooses a man, she chooses a family. Her husband is never the only one whom she must give her love to. When we marry, we leave our parents' home and enter into our husband's family, life interlocked to theirs while alive and when dead. Our hearts, bodies, and soul, who we surrender such things to is a life decision upon which that next half of our lives will be determined upon. Does this mean you chose wrong, mother? Or, did you choose right? How are you supposed to know? I am scared. Will our histories repeat to the next generation? 

Stand tall. Stand upright, stand straight. Even as I have heard the echoes of patriarchy in your words, I have also heard the echoes of feminism. In the same breath you teach me about self preservation you also teach me about self empowerment. Go, you have said. Go as high and as far as you can, in your education, in your career, go until the gossips of others cannot harm you. When actions speak louder than words, if you can live well on your own then there is no reason for the words of others to hurt you. You have said these words to me before, you have said them to me many times. You have said to me that even if others criticize me, as long as I can stand on my own then I do not need to worry and I wish you could understand these words I echo back to you mother because when a woman does not need to rely on someone else for her livelihood then she is not obliged to bend. 

Stand tall then, mother. Stand tall with me. In this crazy thing called life where guarantees do not exist and the roots of suppression cannot be dug out in one generation, stand with me so that we may both lean on each other, so that what you cannot do, I can, and what I cannot do, we will endeavor to. Stand with me, mother, because if you continue to bend then when I follow my heart, when I must shake these roots straight and when I must prune those that may endanger me to rot, then I fear you will fall, and I fear what love there is between us will turn to hate, to shame, to regret, for I cannot continue to bend with you. 

I have fallen in love mother, and I am scared because to love this man means I must shake myself of these roots, and whether it yields sorrows or joys, this life decision was perhaps one that would've come sooner or later. Because I love you I know this decision of mine will hurt you most, but stand tall with me in this choice I've decided upon, because I love you.
