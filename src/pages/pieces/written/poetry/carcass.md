That year alone five </br>
humpback calves washed up, 

bodies precarious </br>
on the coral's razor edge. 

Bellybuttons raw from birth, </br>
parents slap <i>farewell</i>.

But I make this human. </br>
Nani's mother's cinnamon body

screamed into life aboard the ship </br>
her mother died on. <i> Amma</i>,

she would never say. Tamil, </br>
extinct on her tongue. 

At Kahuku Point </br>
can scientists bring to shore

what vanishes at sea, </br>
the one-ton body dragged to Hale'iwa

corn-cobbed by tiger sharks? </br>
Do baby bones reveal holes

of their parents: calcium weakened </br>
by diabetes, molasses, and

rum that the sailors sailed </br>
when they herded

coolie women aboard ships </br>
like the Whitby or Hesperus?

Like the scientists trailing </br>
the deflated body behind boats

for processing, in Lusignan, </br>
Nani's mother cut her

loose to sea.
