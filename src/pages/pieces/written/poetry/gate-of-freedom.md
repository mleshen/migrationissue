(for Palestinian hunger striker, Samer Issawi)
Lovers of asparagus, alive

as hummingbirds, place their nostrils
over a low cloud, wet of air.
It’s the year of green hills
in California that early spring;
the evening is blue-split between the first
snow on the mountain top,
and a computer screen, where news of a man
whose body is eating itself, scythes
the long-stemmed breaths in the room.
“Do not weep if my heart fails,” he writes.
“I am your son.” Gate of Love
Son I have. Your hands bulge
with pear tree blossoms.
You are bellow and sweat,
hunger and bread.
I part the fog to find you
through a grimy crowd of kids.
Before you give in to the affection
that soils you in public,
I’ll promise you a truce.
Gate of the Sun
Bristling down the chemical-
scraped hall uttering
assalamu alaikums to the young
patients from the UAE, their heads sagging
to the side, their bodies a shrine
to tumors, husks of overgrown cells,
the chemo fountain. One boy
stares through a sieve
of darkness, hewn around dark-gray clouds.
Gate of Peace
“I have so many sons withering,”
I whisper to the Chinese elm, as news
of the man whose body is eating itself,
disputes with the bresaola on crisp baguette
that I’m eating in a garden
among the flung-out
blue jays and limping Daddy long legs.
No hymns left;
only a small neck
the sun gnarls through.
