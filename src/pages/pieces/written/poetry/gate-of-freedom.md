(for Palestinian hunger striker, Samer Issawi) <br/>

Lovers of asparagus, alive <br/>
as hummingbirds, place their nostrils <br/>
over a low cloud, wet of air. <br/>
It’s the year of green hills <br/>
in California that early spring; <br/>
the evening is blue-split between the first<br/>
snow on the mountain top,<br/>
and a computer screen, where news of a man<br/>
whose body is eating itself, scythes<br/>
the long-stemmed breaths in the room.<br/>
“Do not weep if my heart fails,” he writes. <br/>
“I am your son.” <br/>

&nbsp &nbsp <i> Gate of Love </i> <br/>

Son I have. Your hands bulge <br/>
with pear tree blossoms.<br/>
You are bellow and sweat,<br/>
hunger and bread.<br/>
I part the fog to find you<br/>
through a grimy crowd of kids.<br/>
Before you give in to the affection<br/>
that soils you in public,<br/>
I’ll promise you a truce.<br/>

&nbsp &nbsp <i> Gate of the Sun </i> <br/>

Bristling down the chemical-<br/>
scraped hall uttering<br/>
assalamu alaikums to the young<br/>
patients from the UAE, their heads sagging<br/>
to the side, their bodies a shrine<br/>
to tumors, husks of overgrown cells,<br/>
the chemo fountain. One boy<br/>
stares through a sieve<br/>
of darkness, hewn around dark-gray clouds.<br/>

&nbsp &nbsp <i> Gate of Peace </i> <br/>

“I have so many sons withering,”<br/>
I whisper to the Chinese elm, as news<br/>
of the man whose body is eating itself,<br/>
disputes with the bresaola on crisp baguette<br/>
that I’m eating in a garden<br/>
among the flung-out<br/>
blue jays and limping Daddy long legs.<br/>
No hymns left;<br/>
only a small neck<br/>
the sun gnarls through.<br/>
