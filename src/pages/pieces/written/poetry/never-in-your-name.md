our names take shape in our mother tongues </br>
our sound is of heliconia brushing the back of a leopard, </br>
or the trill of paradisaeidae at the throb of a lover </br>
echoing in the mouths of mountains clenching rain</br>

our colors are of papaver somniferum, reddening and purple</br>
marking the labor in our hands and the fight in our feet</br>
moving along a pitted earth as we plant futures for you</br>

our bodies are that of mekong, rio grande, suva</br>
splitting nations against the grains of time</br>
among salted breath and shifting shores</br>

our movements are of tigres, mos lwj, stallions</br>
galloping in determined strife</br>
cycling life in a stridden resurgence </br>

we are not Your immigrants, refugees, exiles, illegals </br>
we are the expanse of time breaking tides </br>
we are life as movement whose feet spin the earth</br>

as a carousel around the sun</br>
as samsara binding eons</br>
as rivers granting breath under skin</br>

in the song of our dance</br>
in the spirit of our freedom</br>

we move for you</br>
in our names</br>
making place </br>

this is home</br>
we are home</br>
come home</br>
