i know my history &nbsp &nbsp the ocean <br />
froths over my thighs &nbsp &nbsp so cold i taste

metal &nbsp &nbsp three coasts away <br />
from the airport road &nbsp &nbsp seven countries 

from my garden city &nbsp &nbsp & then of course <br/>
the water &nbsp &nbsp of course

its copper taste &nbsp &nbsp pomegranate <br/>
in my throat &nbsp &nbsp color of all my sisters 

color of all the girls i know &nbsp &nbsp their names <br/>
peeled & sucked &nbsp &nbsp their names 

spit like seeds from car windows <br/>
their names &nbsp &nbsp clinging to every 

lower lip &nbsp &nbsp to every rupture <br/>
sun sets on the pomegranate city 

& where are my sisters </br>
where have they gone
