I climbed those untouched emerald mountains </br>
and watched them in their dens.</br>
With stubborn growls, </br>
they squeezed sustenance from the stones.</br>
The rocks shook, releasing deep notes</br>
to echo around the mountainside:</br>
subdued sighs, joyous howls, high keening.</br>
This was how the savage beasts survived.</br>
This was how they lived </br>
their songs. </br>

I admired their brown hide</br>
ever dark with dirt,</br>
their sleek, luminous eyes,</br>
Their barks thrummed inside</br>
my bones like tiny earthquakes,</br>
spasms to a wild rhythm. </br>

They grew curious and sniffed me.</br>
Theirs was a hard life, </br>
but they still wanted to play. </br>
One day they sang me a song,</br>
of soaring cliffs and pink poppies,</br>
ancestors, spirits, and mists.</br>
I sang a song for them, too:</br>
a lullaby of cold snow, flat earth patches, </br>
a three-souled god.</br>
They laughed and fell asleep.</br>

I grabbed the two smallest beasts </br>
and made my way down the mountain. </br>

In the morning the young creatures woke </br>
with broken-shard cries. </br>
I comforted my beasts </br>
as best as I could. </br>
I sang them songs they’d never heard,</br>
of roaring seas and endless fields. </br>
I gave them ice to live on—as hard as stone,</br>
even if cold and brittle.</br>
The baby brother died,</br>
but his sister— </br>

She is better at singing my songs than me.
